Almost 2,800 burials were excavated, finding evidence that dates use of the site to between 5000 BCE-500 CE.

"A French citizen carries leaflets with the words ""L'as-tu-vue? la joconde!!"" which translates to ""Have you seen her? the Mona Lisa!"" in 1911.⁠ ⁠ On 21 August 1911, the painting was stolen from the Louvre. French poet Guillaume Apollinaire came under suspicion and was arrested and imprisoned. Apollinaire implicated his friend Pablo Picasso, who was brought in for questioning. Both were later exonerated. The real culprit was Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia, who had helped construct the painting's glass case. He carried out the theft by entering the building during regular hours, hiding in a broom closet, and walking out with the painting hidden under his coat after the museum had closed. Peruggia was an Italian patriot who believed that Leonardo Da Vinci's painting should have been returned to an Italian museum. The Mona Lisa remained in his apartment for 2 years until he was caught trying to sell it.

"A man called Ford Cornwall, who was supporting the coal miners, photographed holding a rifle in 1914 in Ludlow, Las Animas County, Colorado, during the Colorado Coalfield War. Credit: @julius.colorization⁠ ⁠ The Colorado Coalfield War was a major labor uprising in the Southern and Central Colorado Front Range between September 1913 and December 1914. Striking began in late summer 1913, organized by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) against the Rockefeller-owned Colorado Fuel and Iron (CF&I) after years of deadly working conditions and low pay. Tensions climaxed on the 20 April 1914 when soldiers from the Colorado National Guard and private guards employed by CF&I attacked a tent colony of 1,200 striking coal miners and their families in Ludlow, Colorado. Known as the Ludlow Massacre, approximately 21 people (including 12 children) were killed. In retaliation, armed miners attacked dozens of mines and other targets over the next ten days, killing strikebreakers, destroying property, and engaging in several skirmishes with the National Guard. Violence mostly ended with the arrival of federal troops in late April 1914, but the strike did not end until December 1914. No concessions were made to the strikers. Described as the ""bloodiest labor dispute in American history,"" an estimated 69 to 199 people died during the strike.⁠ historycolored.com⁠ #history #ushistory #historycolored",historycolored,https://www.instagram.com/p/CsMHOkxMlkG/,post_1106.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AND9HGwKfSzZM1QSsCJXnh58Om59iN3O

"A group of convicts including blues musician Eugene ""Buddy"" Moss (holding the guitar) playing and dancing to music at the Greene County prison camp in Georgia, United States, in May 1941. In 1936, Moss was arrested and tried for the shooting murder of his wife and was convicted and sentenced to prison. By the combination of Moss' own good behavior as a prisoner and the entreaties of two outside sponsors (Long and Columbia Records) willing to ensure his compliance with parole, Moss was released from prison in 1941. Moss continued performing in the area around Richmond, Virginia, and Durham, North Carolina, during the mid-1940s. He performed again with Weaver in Atlanta during the early 1950s, but music was no longer able to maintain a living. He went to work on a tobacco farm, drove trucks, and worked as an elevator operator, among other jobs, over the next 20-odd years.

Those loyal to Denmark would fly the Dannebrog, red with a white Nordic cross, and the supporters of Germany would fly either the black-white-red tricolor flag that was previously the national flag of Germany (but had been changed after the First World War) or the blue-white-red tricolor flag of Schleswig-Holstein.

"A French citizen carries leaflets with the words ""L'as-tu-vue? the joconde!!"" which translates to ""Have you seen her? the Mona Lisa!"" in 1911.⁠ ⁠ On 21 August 1911, the painting was stolen from the Louvre. French poet Guillaume Apollinaire came under suspicion and was arrested and imprisoned. Apollinaire implicated his friend Pablo Picasso, who was brought in for questioning. Both were later exonerated. The real culprit was Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia, who had helped construct the painting's glass case. He carried out the theft by entering the building during regular hours, hiding in a broom closet, and walking out with the painting hidden under his coat after the museum had closed. Peruggia was an Italian patriot who believed that Leonardo Da Vinci's painting should have been returned to an Italian museum. The Mona Lisa remained in his apartment for 2 years until he was caught trying to sell it.

"Men of the Japanese Antarctic Expedition of 1910-1912 photographed in c. 1911 on the deck of their ship Kainan Maru with two sled dogs. The expedition, which was the first such expedition by a non-European nation, was led by Army reserve Lieutenant Nobu Shirase. It took place at the same time as two other major Antarctic expeditions led respectively by Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott, and has been relatively overlooked in polar history. After failing to land in its first season, the Japanese expedition's original aim of reaching the South Pole was replaced by less ambitious objectives, and after a more successful second season, it returned safely to Japan without injury or loss of life.

During the riot, 38 people died (23 black and 15 white). Over the week, injuries attributed to the episodic confrontations stood at 537, with two-thirds of the injured being black and one-third white, and approximately 1,000 to 2,000 lost their homes. Due to its sustained violence and widespread economic impact, it is considered the worst of the scores of riots and civil disturbances across the United States during the ""Red Summer"" of 1919. The state militia was brought in to police the riot and restore order.

"Carl Emil Pettersson photographed in c. 1890 who was a Swedish sailor who became king of Tabar Island in Papua New Guinea after he was shipwrecked in 1904. On a recruiting trip in the Pacific, Pettersson's vessel sank on Christmas Day 1904, off Tabar Island in New Ireland Province. He was washed ashore near a village where he was immediately surrounded by islanders. The islanders carried him to their king, and the king's daughter fell in love with him. In 1907 he married Princess Singdo, the daughter of the local king, Lamy. He got a start in the copra trade and managed to create his own coconut plantation that he called Teripax. He became king after the death of his father-in-law. His nickname among the locals was ""Strong Charley"", and he was famed for his physical strength. Swedish newspapers printed a series of stories about Pettersson and his adventures.
