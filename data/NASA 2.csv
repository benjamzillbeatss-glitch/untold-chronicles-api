"Whimsy or wonder? We'll let you decide  @NASAWebb recently took a look at the Sagittarius B2 molecular cloud: the most massive, and active star-forming region in our galaxy, located only a few hundred light years from the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole. Astronomers want to figure out why this cloud is so much more active than the rest of the galactic center. While Sgr B2 has only 10% of the galactic center's gas, it produces 50% of its stars.   Even with Webb's sensitive infrared capability, which allows it to see through clouds of dust and gas, there are regions so dense that our orbiting telescope can't see through them. These thick clouds are the raw material of future stars—and a cocoon for those still too young to shine.  The first three slides in this carousel show Sgr B2 as seen by Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument, which captured glowing cosmic dust heated by very young massive stars in unprecedented detail. Note that while the dust and gas glow dramatically, all the bright stars disappear from view. In contrast, in near-infrared wavelengths (seen in the last three images), it's the colorful stars that steal the show. Astronomers will seek to discover the masses and ages of these stars to better learn about how they're formed in this dense, active region of the galactic center.

"She’s different, but shines in her own way 🌞   In this photo of Uranus captured by @NASAHubble, its auroras are on full display. But unlike other members of the Solar System, the pair of auroras shine on Uranus’s left and right sides instead of at the top and bottom of the planet.   This is because of how the magnetic poles of Uranus are oriented. Most planets in our Solar System – like Earth – have magnetic poles on opposite vertical ends of the planet, with some tilting slightly to the side. Uranus, however, is the maverick of the planetary family. Its magnetic poles sit on opposite horizontal ends of the planet, as if the planet was lying on its side.   Auroras happen when energetic particles from the Sun collide with a planet’s magnetic shield, transferring their energy to particles in the planet’s atmosphere. When that built-up energy is released, it creates a light show emanating from the magnetic poles. Since Uranus has horizontal poles rather than vertical, its auroras appear on the left and right sides of the planet.   Image description: The sky blue planet of Uranus is centered against black space, glowing with deep blue auroras on its right and left sides.

"Are you in this photo?  On Jan. 10, 2017, an astronaut aboard the International Space Station snapped this pic as the @ISS soared over the northeastern United States at night. Near the center is New York City, with the distinctive shape of Long Island trailing off to the right. Newark and New Jersey sit across the river to the left; Philadelphia is in the bottom-left corner and Hartford, CT is in the top-right. Interstate 95, which connects many of the cities in this image, is visible here as a thin bright line. (Check the coast of Connecticut if you don't see it at first.)   Astronaut photos taken from the space station aren't just pretty pictures: they provide a unique perspective of our changing Earth, especially for hazards and natural disasters.

"Baby, I can see your halo 🌒😇   Astronaut Matthew Dominick on the International Space Station captured this photo of an arc shape, called a partial lunar halo, cradling the Moon on Sept. 4, 2024.    At the time of this photo, the Moon was positioned ‘behind’ Earth’s atmosphere relative to the @ISS. Earth’s atmosphere – seen as layers of orange, white, and blue – acts like a lens, bending light that passes through it and toward the astronaut’s camera.    As that light passed through Earth’s upper atmosphere, it hit ice crystals that form when water vapor freezes onto tiny dust particles. These ice crystals bent, or refracted, the light, forming an arc that looks like a halo by the Moon!   Through NASA’s Artemis campaign, we’re learning more about our Moon than ever before. Next up is Artemis II, which will send a human crew to orbit the Moon for the first time in over 50 years. Follow @nasaartemis for more updates.

"Take some time to enjoy the universe.  6,500 light-years away from Earth, the dusty Pillars of Creation reach out into the cosmos like a giant hand. Young stars are forming within this region of the Eagle Nebula, some ""only"" a few hundred thousand years old.  Our orbiting @NASAWebb telescope captured this view of the Pillars in 2022. Previous images from other telescopes, taken with visible light, were much more opaque—but Webb's near-infrared vision allows it to partially see through these pillars of gas and dust, revealing the stars within. Scientists are using these findings to understand how stars are born and develop into solar systems like our own.  Image description: Layers of semi-opaque, rusty-red gas and dust reach out from the bottom left of the image, forming finger-like pillars that extend into the top right. Peeking through the layers of gas and dust is the background, set in shades of blue and littered with tiny yellow and blue stars.

"Under the sea🪸⁣  ⁣ In 2020, @NASAHubble released this image, nicknamed the “Cosmic Reef,” to celebrate 30 years in space. It shows a giant red nebula and its smaller blue neighbor, which are both part of a vast star-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, located 163,000 light-years away. In this picture, we can see how young, energetic, massive stars illuminate and sculpt their birthplace with powerful winds and searing ultraviolet radiation.⁣  ⁣ At the heart of the big red nebula are sparkling stars, each of which are 10 to 20 times more massive than our Sun. The stars' ultraviolet radiation heats the surrounding dense gas. The massive stars also unleash fierce winds of charged particles that blast away lower-density gas, forming the bubble-like structures seen on the right, which resemble coral.⁣  ⁣ By contrast, the seemingly isolated blue nebula at lower left was created by a solitary mammoth star 200,000 times brighter than our Sun. The blue gas was ejected by the star through a series of eruptive events during which it lost part of its outer envelope of material.⁣  ⁣ Image description: An image is split in two.

"Pardon our dust 🤧⁣  @NASAHubble captured this starry, dusty scene out in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a dwarf galaxy situated about 160,000 light-years away. With a mass equal to 10–20% of the mass of the Milky Way, the Large Magellanic Cloud is the largest of the dozens of small galaxies that orbit our galaxy.⁣  The Large Magellanic Cloud is home to several massive stellar nurseries where gas clouds, like those strewn across this image, coalesce into new stars. This image shows a portion of the LMC’s second-largest star-forming region, where bright, young stars light up the gas clouds and sculpt clumps of dust with powerful ultraviolet radiation.   Hubble observed this area roughly 20 years ago, but this latest observation focused on the dusty clouds that permeate the cluster, providing us with a new perspective on cosmic dust.⁣  Image description: Stars in a star cluster shine brightly blue, with four-pointed diffraction spikes radiating from them.

"One nebula, two views 🔭  @NASAWebb is the largest telescope that’s ever been sent into space—and it has a variety of cameras and other instruments that provide different perspectives on the universe.  The first image here, of a distant planetary nebula known as NGC 6072, was taken with Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera, or NIRCam. NIRCam is designed to capture light in wavelengths from 0.6-5 microns, which corresponds to shades of (visible) red light and near-visible light in the infrared spectrum.   Swipe right for the second image, taken by MIRI: Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument. As the name suggests, MIRI collects light in the middle of the infrared spectrum, just a bit further from visible light than the frequencies studied by NIRCam.  Other telescopes study light in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum: visible light, radio waves, even X-rays and gamma rays! Combining all of this data together gives astronomers a full picture of the cosmos around us.

"Here comes the Sun(-studying spacecraft) Here comes the Sun And I say, ""it’s alright""...  ...if you’re curious about two new NASA missions! Launching later this month, they will study bursts of solar energy that can impact technology and astronauts exploring space.  When the Sun’s magnetic fields reconnect and create a solar flare, it sends out streams of charged particles. NASA’s Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, or IMAP, will track this solar wind as it reaches the boundaries of the solar system and interacts with the local galactic neighborhood beyond.  IMAP will also be able to help provide real-time observations of the solar wind as it approaches Earth, providing about a half-hour’s warning of harmful radiation for spacecraft and astronauts. As Artemis astronauts venture beyond Earth’s magnetic protection to the Moon and Mars, IMAP’s data becomes ever more crucial to fill in missing puzzle pieces that will help mission planners predict and mitigate the effects of space weather.   It will share a ride to space with NASA’s Carruthers Geocorona Observatory. Carruthers will use its post nearly a million miles from Earth to view the exosphere, our home planet’s outermost atmospheric layer that plays a role in space weather.  These two spacecraft will be the latest in a fleet that keeps watch for flares like the one seen in this Solar Dynamics Observatory image, captured on May 14, 2024.

"It’s a full moon today! 🌕  Skywatchers in most of Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia will also be well-positioned to observe a lunar eclipse, or Blood Moon. Totality will begin at about 1730 UTC and last for almost an hour and a half.   The same phenomenon that makes our sky blue and our sunsets red makes the Moon appear reddish-orange as Earth’s shadow falls on the lunar surface.   During a lunar eclipse, Earth is between the Sun and Moon. As sunlight passes through Earth’s air, shorter wavelengths of light — the blues and violets — are scattered throughout our planet’s atmosphere, while longer wavelengths — the reds and oranges — pass through to reach the Moon’s surface. That’s why it’s called a Blood Moon.

"🖤 Dark energy—it’s not just a phase, Mom.  This image from @NASAHubble shows off Abell 209, a massive galaxy cluster located about 2.8 billion light-years away from Earth. Over a hundred galaxies glow in this image, but what occupies the darkness is just as intriguing.   The space between those galaxies is filled with superheated gas, only visible at X-ray wavelengths. And perhaps the most mysterious part of this galaxy cluster is dark matter: a form of matter that does not interact absorb, reflect, or emit light, making it invisible to us. By observing how dark matter affects normal matter, astronomers hypothesize that the universe is made up of about 5% normal matter, 25% dark matter, and 70% dark energy.  Our orbiting Hubble telescope can help us unravel cosmic mysteries like dark matter and dark energy. Galaxy clusters like this one have immense mass that can bend the fabric of spacetime itself, often creating warped and magnified images through a process called gravitational lensing.  This image of Abell 209 shows subtle signs of lensing—can you spot the slight curving of galaxies within the cluster’s hazy golden glow? Astronomers measure how much these galaxies are distorted to better understand the hidden pockets of dark matter and test theories of how our universe came to be.  Image description: A Hubble image of galaxy cluster Abell 209 shows a glowing concentration of multicolored galaxies. Some appear as hazy orange or gold spots, while others are light blue swirls.

"It's a bird! It's a plane! ...It's a super-jet! 🦸⁣ ⁣ @NASAWebb captured this blowtorch of seething gases erupting from a volcanically growing monster star. Stretching across eight light-years, the length of the stellar eruption is approximately twice the distance between our Sun and our next-nearest stars in the Alpha Centauri system. The size and strength of this stellar jet are rare, according to researchers.⁣ ⁣ This serendipitous discovery surprised scientists, who didn't know that a massive star with a jet like this was possible before they spotted this one. While hundreds of stellar jets from protostars have been observed, they are mainly from low-mass stars – unlike this one. Its detection offers evidence that protostellar jets must scale up with the mass of the star powering them: The more massive the stellar engine propelling the plasma, the larger the gusher's size.⁣ ⁣ Image description: Gaseous yellow-orange filaments look like a flower seen from the side and tilted slightly from upper left to lower right, slightly higher than the center of the frame.

"We got it. Let’s try it and rate it 1–10.  When you're living in low Earth orbit for months at a time, your diet can be a little limited. Though we're studying how to grow chili peppers and other veggies on the @ISS as we prepare for long-term missions to the Moon and Mars, almost all of our astronauts' food currently has to blast off from Earth in jam-packed spacecraft, and it has to be shelf-stable and mess-free.

"Long sewing tool, marked by time and use 🪡  This razor-thin galaxy, NGC 4565, is nicknamed the Needle galaxy, because it looks thin as a pin in the view of most telescopes. The first image was captured by our Galaxy Evolution Explorer, or GALEX telescope, and the second was captured by @NASAHubble.  The Needle galaxy is a spiral galaxy, like our own Milky Way, but we cannot see its spiral arms from where we stand. Because of its position relative to Earth, we can only see it edge-on, meaning we are viewing the galaxy’s thin side profile. We would be able to see the galaxy’s familiar spiral shape if we had a face-on view, looking at the flattest part of the structure.  This galaxy is located between 30 and 50 million light-years away from Earth, inside the constellation Coma Berenices.

"No more hiding, I’ll be shining, like I’m born to be! 🎶  Our @NASAWebb Space Telescope captured newborn stars forming in clouds of dust and gas (colored golden and orange in this image) in a star-forming region called Pismis 24. Though these clouds can hide stars by trapping visible light within, in the infrared, the stars shine through the nebula and together appear to glow.  In the center is Pismis 24-1, an object formerly thought to be a single massive star, now known to be at least two stars. At 74 and 66 solar masses, they are some of the most massive and luminous stars ever seen. They are blasting out scorching radiation and stellar winds that are carving a cavity into the wall of the star-forming nebula clouds below and at above right.  The fierce forces shaping and compressing the spires in the glowing gas at the bottom of the scene cause new stars to form. The tallest spire spans about 5.4 light-years from the bottom of the image to its top. More than 200 solar systems could fit into its tip.  A note on the color choices here - cyan indicates hot or ionized hydrogen gas being heated by the massive stars. Dust molecules (similar to smoke on Earth) are represented in orange. Red signifies cooler, denser molecular hydrogen - the darker the red, the cooler the gas. Black is the densest gas; it is not emitting light. The wisps of white are dust and gas scattering starlight.  Pismis 24 is one of the closest sites of massive star birth, giving scientists rare insight into the properties of hot young stars and how they evolve.  Read more at the link in @NASAWebb's bio.

"Pushing the boundaries of what’s possible⁣  ⁣ Our X-59 quiet supersonic research aircraft has just a bit more to go before its first flight. First, it’ll go through medium- and high-speed taxi tests, which focus on how the aircraft handles at higher ground speeds, including braking, steering, stability, and sensor performance. The X-59 team will also assess how well the visibility systems work since the cockpit has no forward-facing window (see the second photo for a close-up).⁣  ⁣ Then, it’s time to take to the skies! This first flight won’t be quiet, but it will let the team check critical systems like engine performance and autopilot and will ensure the aircraft is ready for future flight tests.⁣  ⁣ The X-59 is the centerpiece of NASA’s Quesst mission, which aims to demonstrate quiet supersonic flight by reducing the loud sonic boom to a quieter “thump.”⁣  ⁣ Image descriptions: 1 – The X-59 aircraft sits on the ramp at sunrise.

"X-ray and radio light go “hand in hand” in this new image 🤝  Our orbiting @NASAChandraXray telescope first spotted this nebula, formally known as MSH 15-52, in 2009. At its center lies a pulsar, a rapidly-spinning, incredibly dense star that’s only about 12 miles (19 km) in diameter. It used to be a massive star that collapsed, sending its outer layers outward into space.  Now, new radio data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) are providing us with a fresh view of this exploded star, its environment, and its peculiar properties. This image combines data from both Chandra and the ATCA. Visit chandra.harvard.edu for the full story.  Image description: This is a composite image of a nebula and pulsar that strongly resembles a cosmic hand reaching for a neon red cloud. The neon red cloud sits near the top of the image, just to our right of center. Breaks in the cloud reveal interwoven strands of gold resembling spiderwebs, or a latticework substructure. The bottom half of the image is dominated by a massive blue hand reaching up toward the pulsar and supernova cloud. Inside the hand, streaks and swirls of blue range from pale to navy. The hand and nebula are set against the blackness of space, surrounded by scores of gleaming golden specks. At our lower left, a golden hydrogen gas cloud extends beyond the edges of the image.

"Ever wonder why stars don’t always show up in space photos?  It’s all about how cameras handle light. Cameras can only capture a certain range between the brightest and darkest parts of a scene. Stars are very faint when compared to Earth, the Moon, or other planets. If the camera is set to properly capture the planetary body, the stars can be too dim to see.  Cameras control light with three main settings: shutter speed (how long the camera’s sensor is exposed to light), ISO (the camera’s sensitivity to light), and aperture (how wide the lens opens). You can try to capture both stars and a bright planetary body in one shot, but it’s tricky. One will usually be a little too bright, too dark, or slightly blurry.  In this image, both stars and Earth are visible, but Earth looks a bit blurry because the photographer used a longer shutter speed to bring out the stars, and the motion of the spacecraft caused Earth to blur.   Image description: The bright expanse of Earth dominates the lower half of the image, with dark space speckled with stars in the top half.

"POV: You’re looking at the Moon outside of your window on the Orion spacecraft.   This visualization simulates what the crew of Artemis II might see out the Orion windows on the day of their closest approach to the Moon. It compresses 36 hours into a little more than a minute as it flies the virtual camera on a realistic trajectory that swings the spacecraft around the Moon's far side.  Next year, the Artemis II astronauts could be the first humans to see some parts of the Moon’s far side with the naked eye, depending on the spacecraft’s final trajectory after it launches. During the nine Apollo missions that left Earth’s orbit, astronauts saw parts of the Moon’s far side, but not all of it, as they were limited by which sections were lit during their orbits.  The Artemis II crew’s observations will help pave the way for lunar science activities on future Artemis missions to the Moon’s surface, including Artemis III. Artemis III astronauts will investigate the landforms, rocks, and other features around their landing site. They will also collect rock samples for generations of analyses in Earth labs and set up several instruments to investigate lunar properties and resources — information critical to our future human exploration efforts.

"Some people look up at clouds and see an elephant; some satellites look down at ice and spot a smiley face. 😊   This friendly pattern of cobalt blue water – toward the bottom of this satellite image, left of center – formed as snow and ice melted on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet earlier this summer.   Melt ponds typically begin to dot the edges of the ice sheet in the spring, growing and occasionally connecting in a network of bright blue rivers and pools. The ponded water can drain through cracks in the ice sheet, and if it reaches bedrock at the base of the ice sheet can temporarily speed up the flow of ice toward the coast.   This true-color image was taken by the Landsat 9 satellite as it passed over western Greenland on July 2, 2025.   Have a (n)ice day!

"Gone in the blink of an eye…  …on a cosmic scale, that is. This sparkly galaxy (swipe to see the full view) is home to an unusually high number of extremely hot and massive stars that seem to be on a mission to shed surplus mass as quickly as possible. These intense, brilliant stars, known as Wolf-Rayet stars, can be around 20 times as massive as the Sun, but they don’t last long on a cosmic timescale.  A Wolf-Rayet star can burn up its fuel and blast its bulk out into the universe in only a few hundred thousand years. A typical star of this kind can lose a mass equal to that of our Sun in just 100,000 years!  Though many of the brightest and most massive stars in the Milky Way are Wolf-Rayet stars, it is unusual to find more than a few of these stars per galaxy – except in galaxies like the one in this image.  These massive stars are also incredibly hot, with surface temperatures some 10 to 40 times that of the Sun, and very luminous, glowing at tens of thousands to several million times the brightness of the Sun.

Koch and fellow astronaut Jessica Meir, leading NASA's first all-female spacewalk, repaired a power-charging component on the outside of the @ISS and made other upgrades to the orbiting laboratory.  Koch (pronounced ""Cook"") was selected to become an astronaut in 2013. She helped develop instruments for NASA's Juno spacecraft and worked in Antarctica and Greenland before joining NASA's astronaut corps. Koch is currently training for NASA's Artemis II mission; along with crewmates Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Jeremy Hansen, Koch will lift off from @NASAKennedy in early 2026 for a 10-day flight test around the Moon.

"✅ Left on (infra)red.  Using a specific infrared wavelength of 3.29 microns, NASA’s SPHEREx mission reveals a cloud of dust in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a dwarf galaxy near the Milky Way. This image, taken just weeks after SPHEREx launched in April 2025, represents the dust cloud in visible colors, as infrared light is invisible to the human eye.  A key feature of the SPHEREx mission is spectroscopy—observing individual wavelengths of light from cosmic sources to reveal the composition of objects. Different chemical elements and molecules leave unique “signatures” based on the colors they absorb and emit. Spectroscopy can also help us measure how far away galaxies are, allowing scientists to map the locations of hundreds of millions of galaxies in 3D.  To reveal more about our universe, the SPHEREx mission aims to map the entire sky in 102 infrared colors, or wavelengths of light. The spacecraft will map the entire sky four times over two years, helping us build a 3D map that uncovers the secrets of our universe.

"Put on a happy face 😊⁣  ⁣ While observing the universe, @NASAHubble caught a galaxy cluster smiling for the camera. The cheerful cluster has two orange eyes made of bright galaxies, a white button nose, and smile lines, which are actually arcs caused by an effect known as strong gravitational lensing.⁣  ⁣ Galaxy clusters are the most massive structures in the universe and have such a powerful gravitational pull that they warp spacetime around them and act as cosmic lenses. They can magnify, distort, and bend the light behind them! In this special case of gravitational lensing, a ring — known as an Einstein ring — is produced from this bending of light.⁣  ⁣ Image description: In the middle of the darkness of space, a galaxy cluster looks like a smiling face. Two bright orange galaxies make the eyes, while a white galaxy makes a small nose, and arcs caused by gravitational lensing make the smile and border of the face.

"This star’s nickname is nasty!   No, really. With its official catalog name as NaSt1, this strange star has been given the nickname “Nasty 1.” Imaged by @NASAHubble within our own Milky Way galaxy, it lives around 3,000 light-years away from Earth and is over 10 times the mass of our Sun.   When discovered, it was identified as a Wolf-Rayet star, which is a large, rapidly evolving star. This type of star quickly sheds its outer layers, exposing its hot, bright, helium-burning core.   But Nasty 1 exhibited behavior that astronomers didn’t expect from a Wolf-Rayet star — instead of two lobes of gas flowing in opposite directions from the central star, Nasty 1 has a flat, swirling gaseous disk. Estimates suggest that this might be due to an unseen companion star swiping some of the debris. Scientists also estimate that the gas cloud is only a few thousand years old, and that Nasty 1 represents a brief transitory stage in the evolution of these types of stars.

"Thirteen ways of looking at a red planet: 13 years ago today, Curiosity landed on Mars. Here are 13 remarkable views captured during one of the most extraordinary journeys of all time.   1. To thine own selfie be true: Curiosity is the original Martian self portrait artist, using a camera on the end of its mechanical arm to capture itself and sample holes it has drilled. This shot is from March 2021.  2. This is what Curiosity’s arm looks like, festooned with a variety of science instruments for answering questions about past habitability on the Red Planet.  3. Talk about a trick shot. With a lot of planning and math, NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter team managed to catch Curiosity in the act of descending to the Martian surface on Aug. 5, 2012.  4. Curiosity took this look back at a dune in February 2014.  5. An alien world that also reminds us of home. Curiosity captured this dramatic view of the landscape in Gale Crater in November 2024.  6. A rough road. Years of driving through the harsh terrain took their toll on Curiosity’s wheels, but thanks to careful driving by engineers on Earth, it just keeps on keeping on.  7. Curiosity has collected a treasure trove of data for scientists, including this image of a flower-like rock artifact smaller than a penny from February 2022. Minerals carried by water in the ancient past cemented together helped form this shape.  8. Curiosity looks up as well as down! This shot from January 2014 includes Earth, seen as a pale blue dot in the night sky.   9. In this skywatching moment, Phobos passes in front of the other Martian moon, Deimos, in August 2013.  10. For this postcard in November 2021, Curiosity used its navigation cameras to capture panoramas of this scene at two times of day. Color was added for an artistic interpretation of the scene.  11. No big deal, just watching clouds drift by in the Martian sky in March 2021.  12. The rover saw this view of the Sun setting in April 2015.  13.

The full moon in August is also known as the Sturgeon Moon, reaching its peak this year on the morning of Aug. 9.   In the 1930s, the Maine's Farmer's Almanac first published the Native American names for the full moons, with each Moon name connecting to the season or month it appears. According to this almanac, the Moon names for respective months from January to December are Wolf Moon, Snow Moon, Worm Moon, Sprouting Grass Moon, Flower Moon, Strawberry Moon, Thunder Moon, Sturgeon Moon, Harvest Moon, Hunter's Moon, Beaver Moon, and Long Night's Moon.  The Algonquin tribes of what is now the northeastern United States gave the August Moon its name, recognizing that sturgeon—a large fish found in the Great Lakes and other major bodies of water—were more easily caught this time of year. Other names reported for this Moon include the Red Moon, the Corn or Green Corn Moon, the Barley Moon, the Herb Moon, the Grain Moon, and the Dog Moon.  There are also several names for unusual full moon types, including Blood Moons (occurring during total lunar eclipses, causing a red glow), supermoons (occurring during the moon's closest point in its orbit around Earth, causing a larger-than-usual appearance), Blue Moons (the ""extra"" Moon in a season with four full moons, occurring every two-and-a-half years), and Harvest Moons (the full moons occurring closest to the start of autumn).

"Want to know where fish food flourishes?   What can we say except, “You're welcome!”  With a computer program called MOANA and NASA satellite data, scientists can identify the colorful plant-like organisms that drift in Atlantic Ocean currents. These phytoplankton nourish Earth’s marine life, produce oxygen, absorb carbon, and turn satellite images into vibrant works of art.  The first image, taken by NASA’s Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite on May 16, 2025, shows the natural color of phytoplankton blooming in the nutrient-rich waters off the coast of Namibia.  While each individual phytoplankton is microscopic, blooms of billions can be seen swirling in shades of greens and blues from orbit. Different species appear as different colors, and PACE detects the entire spectrum.   By putting PACE color data into a computer program called Multi Ordination Analysis – the MOANA of this ocean tale – scientists can create maps where three different types of phytoplankton are thriving. The second image dives into the data to map the different communities in teal and purple.   This helps provide insights into the health of schools of fish and other ocean life. Including, perhaps, how far they’ll go.   Image description: Two satellite images show the same portion of the Atlantic Ocean and the southwestern coast of Africa.

It's a type of nebula called a ""planetary nebula.""⁣  ⁣ A nebula is a giant cloud of gas and dust in space, and planetary nebulas are produced by stars like our Sun when they become old and nuclear fusion ceases inside them.

"When your thoughts aren't the only thing swirling around at night    This swirling aurora australis was captured from the @ISS in June 2025. It illuminated the skies just off the coast of New Zealand.   You might have heard the term “aurora borealis” before. The difference between an aurora borealis and an aurora australis is location. Both are caused by energetic solar wind hitting Earth’s magnetic field and dissipating into a colorful light show. Aurora borealis is the name of this phenomenon when it occurs in Earth’s Northern Hemisphere, and it's known as aurora australis when it takes place in the Southern Hemisphere.

"Do you love the color of the (Martian) sky?⁣  ⁣ This Martian sunset, captured by our Curiosity rover, looks quite different from a sunset on Earth. Namely, the color — it’s dark blue, not the familiar pink and orange hue we know from sunsets on our planet.⁣  ⁣ Dust particles in the Martian atmosphere are responsible for this moody blue. The Sun’s light contains a mix of color, and energetic blue light has an easier time getting straight through the dust than other colors like red and yellow. So, the blue light coming into the Sun’s part of the Martian sky stays closer to the Sun than the other colors in the Sun’s mixed rays, which scatter further away from it. This effect is easiest to see at sunset, because the Sun’s rays have further to travel through the Martian atmosphere.⁣  ⁣ Molecules in Earth's atmosphere scatter blue light more than other colors like red and yellow, resulting in the peachy sunsets we know so well from our home planet.⁣  ⁣ This image was taken by our Curiosity rover’s left-eye camera. The camera views color very similarly to human vision, but is slightly less sensitive to blue light than our eyes.⁣  ⁣ Image description: An image of a sunset on Mars, with the sky illuminated a deep, hazy, steely blue.

"A quick, quick midnight snack⁣  ⁣ @NASAHubble and @NASAChandraXray caught a black hole having a feast about 450 million light-years away. Data gathered by the two telescopes point to this being a new possible example of a rare class of black holes: intermediate-mass black holes.⁣  ⁣ Intermediate-mass black holes weigh between a few hundred to a few hundred-thousand times the mass of our Sun and are often invisible to us because they don’t gobble as much gas and stars as the supermassive ones, which would emit powerful radiation. They have to be caught in the act of foraging in order to be found. When they occasionally devour a hapless bypassing star — in what astronomers call a tidal disruption event— they pour out a gusher of radiation.

"The Earth has music for those who listen.   So does one of Earth’s finest phenomena: the aurora. (Also known as the northern lights and aurora borealis in the Northern Hemisphere—or the southern lights and aurora australis in the Southern Hemisphere.)   Pictured here are the northern lights, captured by astronaut Don Pettit aboard the @ISS, as they danced across Earth’s atmosphere. This electric tango happens when charged particles from the Sun move through Earth’s magnetic field and collide with atoms in the upper atmosphere. Depending on which gas is most excited to waltz, different colors will appear.   High-energy electrons cause oxygen to emit green light, while low-energy ones emit red. Nitrogen invites in blue light, and the three often blend together to create an array of pinks, purples, and whites.

"Say cheese!   On July 19, 2013, our Cassini spacecraft had a rare opportunity to show us Saturn, seven of its moons, its inner rings – and, in the background, our home planet. Swipe left and look in between the bright blue E ring and the faint but defined G ring to find Earth. We’re that teeny dot!   Saturn was positioned to block the Sun’s powerful and potentially damaging rays, which let Cassini's onboard cameras take advantage of this unique viewing geometry. With both Cassini's wide-angle and narrow-angle cameras aimed at Saturn, the spacecraft captured 323 images in just over four hours. This natural color mosaic uses 141 of the wide-angle images taken.

The award-winning manned maneuvering unit was designed for a specific type of mission: satellite rescue missions. McCandless would be the first to test the MMU technology. He first flew 150 feet (45 meters) away and returned, then ventured out to 320 feet (97 m) away from the shuttle. This is an orbital spacewalk record that still stands today.⁣  ⁣ McCandless remembered trying to ease the tension for his wife and the flight controllers in Mission Control, saying something similar to Neil Armstrong’s declaration as he first stepped on the Moon in 1969. “It may have been one small step for Neil,” he proclaimed, “but it’s a heck of a big leap for me.”⁣  ⁣ Image description: Astronaut Bruce McCandless II reaches a maximum distance from Challenger before reversing direction in his manned maneuvering unit (MMU) and returning to Challenger.

"When that ol' Moon gets so big and bright 🌕⁣ ⁣ NASA astronaut @astro_christina took this photo of the July 16, 2019, full moon from the @ISS. While the space station crew observes lunar phases from about 260 miles (418 km) above us, you can join them and admire the Moon from the ground. Head outside on July 10 and take a look!⁣ ⁣ Looking at the Moon with just your eyes, you’ll see mostly areas of white and gray. The gray patches are solidified volcanic lava flows. The lighter-colored areas are called the highlands, and show the earliest crust on the Moon, dominated by a type of rock called anorthosite.⁣ ⁣ What you see on the Moon with your eyes only will vary depending on your eyesight. Don’t forget to give yourself plenty of time for your eyes to adjust and look carefully. If you have binoculars or a telescope, you’ll be able to see more details, like Archimedes Crater – a depression that’s 3/4 the size of Washington, D.C. – or the Sea of Tranquility, the site of the first Moon landing.⁣ ⁣ Image description: The full moon is a silvery white circle in the dark night sky in this photo taken from the International Space Station.

"Better luck in Casa Amor — this dramatic star pair needs a recoupling💥  Gas and dust ejected by a dying star at the heart of this nebula came into focus, thanks to data from @NASAWebb.  Its rings, which can only be seen in infrared light, look like “fuzzy” clumps arranged in tangled patterns, and a network of clearer holes close to the central stars shows where faster material punched through. The brighter star in the center is actually two stars that appear as one, which are set off with brilliant diffraction spikes. The stars follow a tight, elongated nine-year orbit and are draped in an arc of dust represented in orange.   One of these stars, which used to be several times more massive than our Sun, took the lead role in producing this scene. Once the star’s outer layers were expelled, only its hot, compact core remained. As a white dwarf star, its winds both sped up and weakened, which might have swept up material into thin shells.   This scene has been forming for at least 4,000 years — and will continue to change over time.  Image description: What looks like a single large, bright star (but is two) shines with bright purple diffraction spikes at the center of a large, diffuse cylinder of gas and dust that is tipped to the right. At the center is a bright pink clumpy cloud that takes up about 25% of the view. The pink region has some holes and diffuse areas. Beyond that are two large rings seen at a roughly 60-degree angle that appear joined at top left and bottom right. The edges are denser, and form shallow V-shapes that go inward. The rings appear orange at top left and bottom right, and are blue at bottom and center right. There is diffuse orange material around the body.

"Riding into orbit 👩‍🚀  On June 18, 1983—42 years ago today—astronaut Sally Ride became the first American woman to travel to space. Ride launched alongside four crewmates on STS-7, the second flight of space shuttle Challenger. The crew deployed two satellites and conducted research on biology, chemistry, and human health during their six days in orbit.  Ride joined the NASA astronaut corps in 1978 with five other women (and 29 men); she flew two missions in space before leaving NASA in 1987, going on to direct the California Space Institute at the University of California, San Diego. A lifelong supporter of space exploration, Ride passed away in 2012 at the age of 61.

"Beyond the clouds ☁️  Through a shroud of thick gas and dust, our @NASAHubble telescope spotted a young, shining star. The swirling discs of material that surround a young star like this are usually funneled into twin jets of gas and dust; this star, however, has material spraying out in a fan-like pattern, traveling at velocities of up to 217 miles per second (350 kps).  Astronomers used Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3, one of the telescope's two main camera systems, to measure how fast this outflow is moving. By measuring its velocity, astronomers are able to determine the star's distance (over 9,000 light-years from Earth), its brightness, and its mass—all vital information that will help shed light on this star's unusual outflow.

"...Hubble bubble  The Bubble Nebula is seven light-years across: big enough that it could comfortably hold our solar system, the nearest star system to ours (Alpha Centauri), and all the space in between. It's being blown up by a seething star, 45 times more massive than our Sun—the big purple one near the center of this image. As hot gas escapes from the star as stellar wind, it runs into cold, interstellar gas around it, forming the outer edge of the bubble like a snowplow piling up snow.  This nebula was first spotted in 1787 by William Herschel, a prominent astronomer who also discovered the planet Uranus. More than 200 years later, our @NASAHubble telescope captured this image of the Bubble Nebula; it was released in 2016 to mark the 26th anniversary of Hubble's time in orbit.

"Peering into the past⁣  ⁣ It took 120 hours of observation time from @NASAWebb to capture this deep field image – and it’s Webb’s deepest look back on a single target to date. There are galaxies in this view that may have existed as early as 200 million years after the big bang!⁣  ⁣ This long exposure of a single area of the sky collected as much light as possible, drawing out the most faint and distant galaxies. This observation was also helped by gravitational lensing: a phenomenon that happens when a massive object (in this case, the galaxy cluster in the foreground) warps space and time, causing light to bend, distort, and magnify as it passes around the massive object. As a result, the images are bright and magnified enough to be studied, despite being distorted.⁣  ⁣ Image Description: A field of red and white galaxies in the darkness of space. At the center is a bright white elliptical galaxy that is the core of a massive galaxy cluster. Many other elliptical galaxies can be seen around it.

"Far out ☮️⁣  ⁣ This magical, mystical scene of a star cluster within a nebula is about 8,000 light-years away from Earth. The massive young stars in the cluster release intense ultraviolet radiation which makes the gas clouds below glow.⁣  ⁣ The brightest light (at the center of where most stars are clustered in the picture), designated Pismis 24-1, was once thought to be a single star with an incredibly large mass of 200 to 300 solar masses. Solar mass is a standard unit of mass in astronomy equal to – you guessed it – the mass of the Sun. That would have made it by far the most massive known star in the galaxy and would have put it considerably above the currently believed upper mass limit of about 150 solar masses for individual stars.⁣  ⁣ @NASAHubble measurements, however, discovered that Pismis 24-1 is actually two separate stars, and, in doing so, ""halved"" their mass to around 100-150 solar masses each.⁣  ⁣ Image description: A group of white and blue stars sparkles in the darkness of space.

"Driving on the Moon? Hot dog! 🌭⁣  This vehicle – which looks like the front half of a famous sausage-shaped car – is one of many lunar rover concepts created for the Apollo program. Part of preparation for the missions was figuring out a design for a lunar vehicle that would allow astronauts a greater range of mobility.⁣  Designers had a lot to consider when creating a Moon rover: weak gravity, a lack of atmosphere, and extreme temperature, to name a few. These factors, frank-ly, imposed severe requirements on the vehicle. Each concept provided data that helped in designing the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) that made its debut during the Apollo 15 mission (swipe to see it).⁣  The LRV, which did not end up being glizzy-shaped, drove at a blistering 5 miles per hour (8 km per hour). Astronaut Dave Scott said of the first trip on the Moon, “This is a super way to travel … This is great … and it’s easy to drive … No problem at all.” Sounds like a bun-believable experience.⁣  During their 67-hour stay on the Moon, Scott and fellow astronaut Jim Irwin used the LRV to make three separate motor trips to explore the rim of Hadley Rille, deep crater edges, and the Apennine Mountains. The LRV more than met its goal of increasing movement, as Scott and Irwin covered almost four times as much lunar terrain as the total covered by the crews of the Apollo 11, 12, and 14 missions before them.⁣  Image descriptions:⁣ 1. An astronaut stands near a lunar rover concept that looks like the front half of the Weinermobile attached by a hose to a platform with large fan-like wheels. The front half has the same wheels, as well as an open hatch on the side and small windows in the front. The photo is in black and white.⁣  2. At right, astronaut Jim Irwin works at the LRV on the Moon. The rover looks noticeably different from the concept vehicle in the previous image.

"Not your ordinary spiral...  At first glance, UGC 11397 looks like a typical spiral galaxy: two graceful arms, illuminated by stars, stretch out from its core. The heart of UGC 11397 hides what makes this galaxy unique, though—a supermassive black hole 174 million times the mass of our Sun. And it's still growing.  Material trapped by the black hole emits light in frequencies from radio waves to gamma rays, but thick clouds of dust hide most of this from view in the visible spectrum. X-ray emissions, though, helped astronomers uncover this cosmic phenomenon.  This image of UGC 11397 was taken by our orbiting @NASAHubble telescope.

Deimos is much, *much* smaller than Earth's Moon: it's about 9 by 7 by 6.8 miles (15x12x11 km) in size. Because it's so tiny, its gravitational forces make it more of a lump than a sphere.

"All eyes on me ☄️⁣  ⁣ When @NASAHubble captured this image of Comet ISON on April 30, 2013, the comet was closer to the Sun than Jupiter's orbit. First spotted 585 million miles away in September 2012, the comet became the subject of a massive global observation campaign incorporating space-based and ground-based telescopes and participation from citizen scientists and professional and amateur astronomers. Why was ISON so special?⁣  ⁣ As a comet travels through the solar system, it faces many perils. Before it reaches Mars, the Sun’s radiation begins to boil its water. A giant ejection of solar material from the Sun could rip its tail off. And, if it survives all this, the intense radiation and pressure as it flies near the surface of the sun could destroy it altogether. Comet ISON was making its first trip around the Sun, which meant it was still made of pristine matter from the earliest days of the solar system’s formation. ISON was, like all comets, a dirty snowball made up of dust and frozen gases like water, ammonia, methane, and carbon dioxide – some of the fundamental building blocks that scientists believe led to the formation of the planets 4.5 billion years ago.⁣  ⁣ By tracking its journey, scientists could learn what the comet was made of and how it reacted to its environment. They could also learn more about the origins of the solar system.⁣  ⁣ Just prior to its closest approach to the Sun on Nov. 28, 2013, Comet ISON went through a major heating event, and was torn to pieces. What remained of Comet ISON appeared to brighten and spread out, then fade. The legacy of the data collected during this great observation, however, would go on for years as scientists analyzed what they found.⁣  ⁣ Image description: A white comet with a long, fuzzy tail rises up diagonally to the right.

"Star power 🌟   The Carina Nebula complex is one of the most energetic star-forming areas in our galaxy — within it lies the Keyhole Nebula, pictured here by the European Southern Observatory. Our Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) was able to detect the magnetic field streamlines shown over this image.   Eta Carinae, a huge active star neighboring the Keyhole Nebula, could have influenced the nebula's shape with its strong winds. Data from SOFIA's observations show that the magnetic fields in the loop seem affected by the star's strong wing. The magnetic field spreads out in a fan shape, matching the wind from Eta Carinae. This shows that the magnetic field is being disturbed by the star's energy.   The magnetic field in the loop is much weaker than the star's wind, which means that while magnetic fields are important in the early stages of star formation, they don’t do much to stop the cloud from being broken apart by the energy from massive stars. Scientists now wonder if the same is true in other places where big stars are forming.   Image description: The Keyhole Nebula glows in shades of blue, pink and purple. In the center of the nebula, the magnetic fields are identified by what resembles a wind pattern, moving in swirls around a loop in the center.

"More passion, more energy 🕺   The amazing dancing lights we can see close to the North and South Poles of Earth happen on other planets, too, and @NASAWebb captured new details of auroras on the biggest planet in our solar system. Observations show that auroras on Jupiter are huge in size and are also hundreds of times more energetic than auroras on Earth.   On Earth, auroras are caused by solar storms. When charged particles rain down on the upper atmosphere, it excites gases and causes them to glow colors of red, green, and purple. On Jupiter, there's an additional source of auroras — the magnetic field of the gas giant grabs charged particles from its surroundings, including its tumultuous volcanic moon, Io.  Io’s estimated 400 volcanoes spew particles that escape the moon’s gravity and orbit Jupiter. During a solar storm, a barrage of charged particles is unleashed onto the planet. Jupiter’s large and powerful magnetic field captures charged particles and accelerates them to tremendous speeds. These speedy particles slam into the planet’s atmosphere at high energies, which excites the gas and causes it to glow.   Now, Webb’s unique capabilities are providing new insights into the auroras on Jupiter. The telescope’s sensitivity allows astronomers to increase the shutter speed to capture the quick changes of auroral features.   Visual descriptions:  1. The planet Jupiter as seen in near-infrared light. Its clouds are dark blue and white in color, with some red spots within the clouds, while its poles are tinged with green, yellow, and red.

"Hotter than the bluest flame 🔥    Our friends at the @EuropeanSpaceAgency recently shared a dazzling young star cluster as astronomers have never seen it before.     This star cluster, NGC 346, is located in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way about 200,000 light-years away. Though @NASAHubble has studied this cluster before, this image is the first to combine Hubble’s observations made at infrared, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths, giving an intricate view into the star-forming factory.     NGC 346 is home to more than 2,500 newborn stars. The cluster’s most massive stars, which are many times more massive than our Sun, blaze with intense blue light in this image. Researchers used two sets of observations taken 11 years apart to trace the motions of NGC 346’s stars, revealing them to be spiraling in toward the center of the cluster. This spiraling motion arises from a stream of gas from outside of the cluster that fuels star formation in the center of the turbulent cloud.    Image description: A star cluster within a nebula. Thin, pale-blue wisps of clouds fill the background while denser areas of pinkish clouds appear superimposed upon them. The star cluster holds bright-blue stars that illuminate the nebula.

"Time to power up 🔋     The International Space Station (@ISS) gets its power from the largest power source in our solar system - the Sun. Most spacecraft use solar panels to harness the Sun's continuous energy and provide power to keep the spacecraft working and at the right temperature.     Solar panels (like this set of solar arrays on the station) must be designed around two key factors: size and reliability. The size of the panels affects the cost of launch, while the reliability determines how the panels withstand the harsh environment of space, including temperature swings, radiation, and micrometeoroid impacts.     The current wingspan of our space station's solar array, 356 feet (109 meters), is longer than the world's largest passenger aircraft. The solar panel pictured above is one of eight that generate approximately 95 kilowatts of power for a total of up to 215 kilowatts (215,000 watts) of power available to keep the station running.

"That’s one speedy spud 🥔⁣ ⁣ @NASAHubble took 13 separate exposures over 22 minutes to create this time-lapse image of tiny, potato-shaped moon Phobos (at left) orbiting around Mars. Phobos is so small that it looks like a star in these Hubble photos.⁣ ⁣ This little tater is fast, though: Phobos orbits Mars in just 7 hours and 39 minutes, which is faster than Mars rotates. The moon’s orbit is very slowly shrinking, meaning it will eventually – as in, 50 million years from now – break up under Mars’ gravitational pull, or crash onto the planet.⁣ ⁣ Poor little Phobos has already been battered: it was nearly shattered by a giant impact, and has gouges from thousands of meteorite impacts.⁣ ⁣ Here are a few more fun facts about Phobos:⁣ - It has no atmosphere.⁣ - It’s the larger of Mars’ two moons. The other moon is called Deimos.⁣ - The fine dust on Phobos’ surface cannot retain heat.⁣ ⁣ Image description: Tiny moon Phobos travels behind Mars in this image. The moon appears multiple times, since this is a time-lapse photo. Phobos is a small silvery dot here. Mars dominates the photos.

"“I don’t know why I go to extremes.” —Jupiter (probably)     The planet is home to fierce jet streams, polar cyclones bigger than Australia, the most powerful aurora and harshest radiation belts in the solar system - and we’re just scratching the surface.      Data from Juno helped develop a new model to better understand the fast-moving jet stream that encircles Jupiter’s cyclone-festooned north pole. Juno took the first-ever temperature measurement of the cap of Jupiter’s atmosphere above the north pole: it’s about 52ºF (11ºC) cooler than its surroundings and is encircled by winds exceeding 100 mph (161 kph). Unlike hurricanes on Earth, which typically occur in isolation and at lower latitudes, Jupiter’s massive northern polar cyclone and the eight cyclones that encircle it are confined to the polar region. Jupiter’s cyclones cluster together while approaching the pole, and their motion slows as they begin interacting with neighboring cyclones.     Image description: An enhanced-color image split into two frames shows Jupiter’s northern high latitudes from an altitude of about 36,000 miles (58,000 km) above the giant planet’s cloud tops during the spacecrafts 69th flyby on Jan. 28, 2025.

"Add a pop of color! 🎨⁣  ⁣ When the cameras on NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft first spotted the large reddish polar region on Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, mission scientists knew two things: they’d never seen anything like it elsewhere in our solar system, and they couldn’t wait to get the story behind it.⁣  ⁣ Turns out Pluto is something of a graffiti artist – methane gas escapes from Pluto’s atmosphere, becomes “trapped” by Charon’s gravity, and freezes to the cold, icy surface at the moon’s pole. When it’s springtime on Charon, the returning sunlight triggers the frozen methane to change back into gas, which leaves behind heavier chemical compounds. Sunlight further irradiates those leftovers into reddish material that has slowly accumulated on Charon’s poles over millions of years.⁣  ⁣ The image combines blue, red, and infrared images taken by New Horizons’ Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC); the colors are processed to best highlight the variation of surface properties across Charon. New Horizons was the first spacecraft to explore Pluto up close. In early 2019, New Horizons flew past its second major science target – Arrokoth, the most distant object ever explored up close.⁣  Image description: Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, is gray with a jagged line of fractures and canyons going across it diagonally.

"Can we get an encore?  A planetary nebula located just 4,600 light-years away in the Milky Way galaxy puts on a spectacular display at the end of a giant star's life. The image itself was the final work of one of @NASAHubble's instruments: the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). First installed in 1993, the WFPC2 was replaced in 2009 by the Wide Field Camera 3 during Hubble’s final servicing mission.  The swirling, paint-like clouds in the darkness of space are clouds of ionized atoms thrown into space by a dying star. Its red giant star had exhausted its available fuel and shed its last layers of gas, enabling nuclear fusion as its compact core begins to contract further. The exposed core reaches extremely hot temperatures, radiating ultraviolet light that energizes the enormous clouds of gas cast off by the star.   In this image, red and orange indicate nitrogen, green is hydrogen, and blue shows oxygen. The spectacle is bittersweet, as the brief phase of fusion in the core will end after only tens of thousands of years, leaving a white dwarf that will never illuminate the clouds around it again.  Image description: A glowing, jagged ring encircles a small central region of greenish clouds, making it appear like a hole torn in fabric.

"Sculpted by luminous stars 🌟⁣  ⁣ The dazzling, young stars in this cluster are artists: with the intense radiation and fierce stellar winds they produce, they sculpted the glowing pink nebula and snakelike dark clouds you see here.⁣  ⁣ This star cluster is in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way that lies 200,000 light-years away in the constellation Tucana. It has been studied before by @NASAWebb and @NASAHubble, but this image includes new data and is the first to combine Hubble observations made at infrared, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths into an intricately detailed view of this vibrant star-forming factory.⁣  ⁣ This “artists collective” contains more than 2,500 newborn stars. The cluster’s most massive stars, which are many times more massive than our Sun, blaze with an intense blue light in this image. Hubble was instrumental in uncovering the secrets of how these stars formed. Using two sets of observations taken 11 years apart, researchers traced the stars’ motions and found that they were spiraling in toward the center of the cluster. This spiraling motion comes from a stream of gas from outside of the cluster that fuels star formation in the center of the turbulent cloud.⁣  ⁣ Image description: Bright blue stars curve gently toward the center of the image. Nestled around, in front of, and behind the clustered stars are large arcs of dense, reddish-brown dust. Thin, pale-blue wisps of clouds fill the background while denser areas of pinkish clouds appear stacked upon the wispier clouds.

"Livin' life in low Earth orbit   For nearly 25 years, @NASAAstronauts have been living and working aboard the International Space Station. Some have only stayed for a few days, while some have lived in space for over a year at a time. (Astronaut Frank Rubio holds the NASA record, with a 371-day stay.) Some have traveled to the @ISS several times, while some are making their first visit—like NASA's Nichole Ayers, seen here opening the hatch to the station's Kibo laboratory. Ayers launched to the station on NASA's SpaceX Crew-10 mission, which lifted off from @NASAKennedy on March 14.  The International Space Station is an orbiting laboratory, built to help us learn how to live in space while making life better back on Earth. We work with crew members and researchers from around the world to study human health, medicine and biology, materials research, Earth science and countless other scientific disciplines.

"Heading into the weekend like... 🧑‍🚀  On February 7, 1984, astronaut Bruce McCandless II became the first human in history to go on a spacewalk without a connection to their spacecraft. McCandless soared outside the space shuttle Challenger with the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), a propulsion device on the back of his spacesuit that used two tanks of hydrogen and 24 nozzles to move him around.   In this iconic photo, taken by Challenger pilot Hoot Gibson, McCandless was just a few meters away from the shuttle, but further MMU flights by McCandless and astronaut Robert L. Stewart took them more than 300 feet (91 meters) into space. The MMU was used for several more flights in the 1980s.

"View from a lifeboat  Apollo 13 astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert launched from @NASAKennedy on April 11, 1970. They were headed to the Fra Mauro region of the Moon for the third lunar landing ever. Everything seemed to be going smoothly until the third day of the mission, when an oxygen tank ruptured and Swigert uttered those famous words: “Houston, we’ve had a problem here.”  The new mission plan was to abandon the Moon landing, loop around the Moon, and get the crew home safely as quickly as possible. The crew needed to go into “lifeboat mode,” using the lunar module Aquarius to save the spacecraft and crew. The Apollo 13 crew took this photo of the Moon from the lunar module as they passed by.  On April 17, the crew returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa. The Apollo 13 mission is sometimes called a “successful failure”: Though the crew couldn’t achieve their scientific goals, the rescue mission was a huge victory for NASA. The lessons learned from Apollo 13 were rapidly applied to the remaining Apollo missions and continue to guide us at NASA today.

These hot, young stars emit radiation, which energizes the cooler gas in the cloud that surrounds them.⁣  ⁣ Astronomers call this object and others like it “HII” (pronounced “H-two”) regions. An HII region is created when the radiation from hot, young stars strips away the electrons from neutral hydrogen atoms in the surrounding gas to form clouds of ionized hydrogen, which is denoted scientifically as “HII.” Scientists study these areas with telescopes like @NASAChandraXray because young stars are bright in X-rays. Also, X-rays can penetrate the shrouds of gas and dust surrounding these infant stars, allowing astronomers to see how stars are formed with details that would be otherwise missed.⁣  ⁣ This composite image contains X-ray data from our Chandra X-ray Observatory and the ROSAT telescope (purple), infrared data from our Spitzer Space Telescope (orange), and optical data from the SuperCosmos Sky Survey (blue) made by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope.⁣  ⁣ Image description: This region looks like purple and blue drops of paint layered between streaks of orange and blue. There is color almost everywhere, though the blackness of space can be seen on the outer edges of the image. Stars are scattered all over; three shining stars nearly in a vertical line in the middle of the image stand out the most. There are bubbles, or cavities, that have been created by radiation and material blowing away from the surfaces of massive stars.⁣  ⁣ Credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/PSU/L.

"Galactic neighbors: close enough to wave, too far to visit (for now)⁣  ⁣ Say hello to one of our Milky Way’s closest neighboring galaxies, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The dwarf galaxy is located about 200,000 light-years away, which makes it close enough to be visible from Earth without the help of a telescope or binoculars. For viewers in the Southern and some latitudes in the Northern hemisphere, the SMC resembles a piece of the Milky Way that has broken off — though it is much farther away than any part of our own galaxy.⁣  ⁣ In this image, we can see SMC in higher detail than what we would be able to see with our own eyes. This is thanks to @NASAHubble’s Wide Field Camera, which was used by astronomers to observe the galaxy through four different filters. Each filter permits different wavelengths of light, creating a multicolored view of dust clouds drifting across a field of stars. Here, Hubble is zoomed in on a small region of the SMC, to a star cluster that is home to dozens of massive young stars.⁣  ⁣ Image description: An area of space filled with stars. Most of the stars are small, distant dots in a range of orange colors; closer stars shine with a bright glow and hold four thin diffraction spikes around them.

"Your screen isn't fuzzy—you're looking at planets 130 light-years away.  Exoplanets, or planets beyond our solar system, are so small that we usually detect them by measuring the effect they have on their star: they may cause the star to wobble a bit, or make it a little less bright as they pass in front of it. But our @NASAWebb telescope is so powerful that it can spot, not just distant stars, but the much smaller worlds that orbit them.   The HR 8799 star system has long been of interest to astronomers for what it can tell us about how planets form, and Webb is giving us a better look at it than ever. Not only are we getting a direct look at these four gas giants, Webb's data tells us that these worlds are rich in carbon dioxide, suggesting that they formed similarly to Jupiter and Saturn in our home system.  Image description: Four fuzzy planets are scattered across a black background in this annotated photo. Each planet has a letter and dashed line next to it, indicating the planet's name.

"Now you’re thinking with portals!⁣  ⁣ This composite picture of the Helix Nebula combines images from @NASAHubble and the National Science Foundation's 0.9-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory to give us a dizzying view down a trillion-mile-long tunnel of glowing gases. Because this radiant tube is pointed nearly directly at Earth, it looks more like a circle or bubble than a cylinder.⁣  ⁣ Look closely around the circle, and you may notice thread-like structures pointing toward the center. These filaments formed when a hot ""stellar wind"" of gas plowed into colder shells of dust and gas ejected previously by the small, super-hot white dwarf star at the center of this nebula.⁣  ⁣ Like Hubble, you too can study the Helix Nebula.

"See some supersonic shockwaves 👀   You're looking at two T-38 jets, soaring faster than the speed of sound—flying in formation just 30 feet (9 meters) apart. This image was taken using a technique called schlieren photography, which measures the flow of air around objects. When an aircraft goes supersonic (about 760 miles an hour, or 1220 kph, at sea level), it sends shockwaves through the air, rapid pressure changes which are responsible for the sonic boom you may hear on the ground.   This photo was taken by a @NASA aircraft in 2019—the first flight ever to capture interacting shockwaves from two supersonic aircraft. Images like these are helping us design our @NASAAero X-59 aircraft, which aims to fly at supersonic speeds without creating loud sonic booms. X-59 is currently gearing up for its first flight later this year.   Image description: Two jet planes, seen from below, fly through a bright blue background.

"A firestorm of stars 🔥  This @NASAHubble image takes a close-up look at Centaurus A, one of the brightest galaxies in Earth's night sky. At some point in the past, Centaurus A collided with another galaxy; the resulting shockwaves caused clouds of hydrogen gas to compress, setting off a firestorm of newly-forming stars. These stellar hot spots can be seen in red here, peeking out through the galaxy's dust.  Hubble took this image in 2010 with its Wide Field Camera 3.

"Cosmic bubble gum⁣ 🫧  ⁣ This candy-colored confection is a planetary nebula nicknamed the Little Gem Nebula. Located 6,000 light-years away from us in the constellation of Sagittarius, this Little Gem has a rather interesting shape – and that’s thanks to the way it was made.⁣  ⁣ When stars like the Sun enter “retirement,” they shed their outer layers into space to create glowing clouds of gas called planetary nebulae. This ejection of mass is uneven, and planetary nebulae can have very complex shapes. The Little Gem took on the shape of a bright, enclosed central bubble with filament-like structures surrounded by a more diffuse bubble.⁣  ⁣ Scientists believe that the stellar wind from the central star propels the outward-flowing material, sculpting the nebula’s elongated shape. As this fast wind smashes through the slower-moving cloud, it creates particularly bright blowouts at the bubble’s outer layers.⁣  ⁣ Image description: The Little Gem Nebula looks like two blue and purple cloudy bubbles, with bright streaks of red in the middle and on the outer edges.

"A cosmic cherry on top 🍒⁣ ⁣ @NASAWebb treated us to a sweet perspective: Herbig-Haro 49/50—a towering swirl from a nearby protostar—is (coincidentally) topped with a multi-hued spiral galaxy.⁣ ⁣ Herbig-Haro objects are outflows produced by jets launched from a nearby, forming star. The outflows, which can extend for light-years, plow into a denser region of material. This creates shock waves, heating the material to higher temperatures. The material then cools by emitting light at visible and infrared wavelengths.⁣ ⁣ The galaxy that appears, by chance, at the tip of this cosmic soft-serve is a much more distant, face-on spiral galaxy. It has a prominent central bulge represented in blue, filled with older stars. The bulge also shows hints of “side lobes,” suggesting that this could be a barred spiral galaxy. Reddish clumps within the spiral arms show the locations of warm dust and groups of forming stars.⁣ ⁣ Image description: This cosmic image is dominated with billowing clouds of orange-red gas, rich in detail.

"Status: It’s complicated.⁣  ⁣ @NASAWebb captures a rare cosmic phenomenon in this new image, called an Einstein ring. What may look like one strangely-shaped galaxy is actually two galaxies separated by a large distance. The closer galaxy sits at the center of the image, while the more distant background galaxy appears to be wrapped around the closer galaxy, forming a ring.⁣  ⁣ Now, stay with us here — the light from the more distant galaxy is being bent (or lensed) by the closer, massive galaxy. This is possible because spacetime, the fabric of the universe itself, is bent by mass. Therefore, the light traveling through space and time is bent, as well. While too subtle to observe on smaller scales, the astronomical proportions allow us to observe the curvature of light.⁣  ⁣ Only at the perfect alignment — between the lensed object and the lensing object — can this distinctive Einstein ring shape be seen.⁣  ⁣ Image description: In the center is an elliptical galaxy, seen as an oval-shaped glow around a small bright core.

"Birds of a feather, we should stick together A binary pair of actively forming stars is responsible for this shimmering hourglass of gas and dust. Here, @NASAWebb’s ability to see near-infrared light reveals incredible detail and structure in Lynds 483 (L483).The two protostars lie in the center of the hourglass shape, ejecting gas and dust. When more recent cosmic material clashes with old, the varying densities cause the shimmering twists and twirls you see in this image. There are black “voids” where stars don’t shine through (particularly to the left of the bottom part of the hourglass)—this is where dust is so thick that little starlight penetrates. Even Webb, which is designed to see through dust and gas, only perceives the background stars as dim pinpoints of light. Above and below the flattened disk at the center, the dust is thinner and the bright light from the stars shines through, forming the large semi-transparent orange cones that glow around the outline of the hourglass.Millions of years from now, when the stars have finished forming, and have swept the area clean, they may each be about the mass of our Sun. All that may remain is a tiny disk of gas and dust where planets may eventually form.Read more at the link in @nasawebb’s bio. Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI#Space #Stars #NASA #ESA #JWST #Astronomy #SXSW",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/DG51S_ludWS/,post_147.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tWJUdWEyRkXnOw4Kt8JTTqNkPoOaP3MX

During maximum afterburner testing – a test that demonstrates the engine’s ability to create the thrust needed for supersonic flight – a photographer caught a cool visual phenomenon in the X-59’s exhaust called Mach diamonds. Also known as shock diamonds, Mach diamonds occur when the pressure of the gases exiting the nozzle is less than the ambient air pressure.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ One of the major problems with commercial supersonic flight is the loudness of a sonic boom.

"What lies beneath⁣  ⁣ In this image, Venus may look like a serene planet, with white and tan clouds reminding us of a cozy cup of coffee. In reality, Venus is a world of intense heat, crushing atmospheric pressure, and clouds of corrosive acid.⁣  ⁣ The clouds seen here are comprised of sulfuric acid particles, as opposed to water droplets or ice crystals like on Earth. On top of being made of corrosive acid, these Venusian clouds whip around the planet at nearly over 200 mph (322 kph), circling the planet in about four and a half days.⁣  ⁣ So far, we’ve got acidic clouds and hurricane-force winds. Underneath the clouds lies extreme heat and pressure: Venus is hotter even than the innermost planet, Mercury. Venus’ thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, giving it surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead! Finally, the surface pressure on Venus is 92 times that of Earth’s. To experience that pressure on our home planet, you’d have to dive more than 3,000 feet (915 m) into the ocean.⁣  ⁣ So why do we study this seeming hellscape of a planet? Although it’s not currently habitable, Venus lies within the Sun’s ""Goldilocks zone,"" and may have been habitable before Earth. We want to understand how Venus became an inferno-like world when it has so many other characteristics similar to ours. Future missions like DAVINCI, VERITAS, and EnVision will seek to answer this question.⁣  ⁣ Image description: The clouds on Venus are mostly white, with patches of tan that bring to mind milk swirling through a cup of coffee.

"She doesn’t even go here!⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ When astronomers first studied the globular star cluster seen here in an image from @NASAHubble, they found that it appeared to be around 30% younger than other similar clusters in the Milky Way. If this cluster – Palomar 12 – was born in our galaxy, then it would be around the same age as other Milky Way globulars… so it couldn’t be from here.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Further study revealed that Palomar 12 was actually ripped from its initial home, the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical galaxy, around 1.7 billion years ago by tidal interactions between its former home and our galaxy. The dwarf galaxy that Palomar 12 once called home is a satellite galaxy to ours, and closely orbits around us — even occasionally passing through the plane of our galaxy.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Globular clusters like Palomar 12 can contain anywhere from tens of thousands to millions of stars, packed tightly together in dense clumps ranging from 50 to 450 light-years across.

"“Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us.” — Carl Sagan, ""Pale Blue Dot,"" 1994⁣⁣  ⁣⁣ Our Voyager 1 spacecraft took this iconic image of Earth 35 years ago. Voyager 1 was so far away — 3.7 billion miles (6 billion km) — from the Sun that, from its vantage point, Earth was just a point of light about a pixel in size. Truly a “Pale Blue Dot.”⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Mission managers commanded the spacecraft to look back toward home for a final time. It snapped a series of 60 images that were used to create the first “family portrait” of our solar system.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Carl Sagan was a prominent planetary scientist who was a consultant and adviser to NASA beginning in the 1950s. He also was a member of the Voyager Imaging Team. He had the original idea in 1981 to use the cameras on one of the two Voyager spacecraft to image Earth. He realized that because the spacecraft were so far away the images might not show much. This was precisely why Sagan and other members of the Voyager team felt the images were needed — they wanted humanity to see Earth’s vulnerability and that our home world is just a tiny, fragile speck in the cosmic ocean.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ After snapping the Pale Blue Dot and other “family photos,” Voyager 1 powered off its cameras forever to save its energy for the long journey ahead. In August 2012, Voyager 1 entered interstellar space. It’s now the most distant human-made object ever.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Image description: Earth is a single, bright blue pixel in the vastness of space.

The Voyager images showed that Rhea’s features could be divided into two regions: heavily cratered terrain with craters larger than 25 miles (40 kilometers) across and a second type of area in parts of the polar and equatorial region with craters less than 25 miles (40 kilometers) across. This difference may indicate there was a major resurfacing event some time in Rhea’s history.⁣  ⁣ Dione is Saturn’s fourth-largest moon. It also has terrain with varying amounts of craters, along with fractured areas that often cut through its plains and craters. These fractures suggest Dione experienced tectonic activity in its past.

"Stars hatched by a swan 🌟  Our WISE telescope captured this image, released in June 2011, of a huge complex of star-forming clouds and stellar clusters in the constellation Cygnus. Star clusters are groups of stars that share an origin, forming at roughly the same time and location, and are tied together by gravity for up to millions or even billions of years.  Different types of stars have different life spans, so clusters will change over time as stars evolve. Some clusters might contain big, hot, O-type stars. Others might hold smaller, cooler stars that age and change over billions of years. Star clusters can contain anywhere from as few as a dozen stars to upwards of millions, and those stars can be spread out over a few light-years to hundreds of light-years.  WISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) was an infrared-wavelength astronomical space telescope. It was placed into hibernation in February 2011, having completed its primary astrophysics mission. Then, in 2013, the spacecraft was assigned a new mission as NEOWISE (Near-Earth Object Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer), to help find near-Earth asteroids and comets. Its mission ended on July 31, 2024.  Image description: This image is dominated by curving green clouds, except at top left and middle, where there are also red clouds.

"Jewels just beyond the spider’s realm 🕷   Dust gets a bad rap, doesn’t it? It’s a nuisance in houses, but out in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), it adds to the beauty of the scene. @NASAHubble captured this image of part of the LMC – the outskirts of the Tarantula Nebula – marked by gas, patches of dust, and many-colored stars.   The stars here get their different colors thanks to that dust: Dust absorbs and scatters blue light more than red light, allowing more of the red light to reach our telescopes, which makes the stars appear redder than they are.   Using Hubble observations of dusty nebulae in the Large Magellanic Cloud and other galaxies, researchers can study these dust grains, helping them better understand the role that cosmic dust plays in the formation of new stars and planets.

"Looking to the fuschia 💖⁣ ⁣ Our @NASAChandraXray observatory captured this colorful scene of two spiral galaxies merging. This galaxy pair is located about 250 million light-years away and can be found in the constellation of Serpens. ⁣ ⁣ The collision of the two spiral galaxies happened about 700 million years ago, sparking an enormous burst of star formation. About 200 huge star clusters reside in a packed, dusty region about 5,000 light-years across—about 5% of the Milky Way’s diameter. The amount of gas in this tiny region is equal to all of the gas in the entire Milky Way. ⁣ ⁣ Image description: This composite image features an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy, surrounded by a soft, rose-pink cloud of X-ray gas. Here, a single, bright, golden white dot sits at the center of the image. The rose-pink cloud surrounding the dot appears soft and airy, like cotton candy. Upon close inspection, feint orange veins can be discerned, marbling the X-ray gas cloud seen with Chandra. Surrounding the gas cloud are other distant galaxies and stars, set against the blackness of space.

"A dartboard in the rec room of our universe 🎯⁣  ⁣ A massive galaxy nicknamed Bullseye ripples with nine star-filled rings as a blue dwarf galaxy plunges through the center like a dart. The smaller galaxy, visible just to the left of center in this image, shot through the middle of Bullseye about 50 million years ago, leaving rings like ripples in a pond. Galaxies collide or barely miss one another quite frequently (cosmically speaking) but it’s rare for one galaxy to dive through the center of another.⁣  ⁣ High-resolution imagery from @NASAHubble, which captured this image, confirmed eight of Bullseye’s rings, with data from the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii finding a ninth. Astronomers will now be able to better study how the galaxy—and its rings—may continue to evolve over billions of years.⁣  ⁣ Image description: A large galaxy is at center, and a significantly smaller galaxy is to its left. It has several rings. Its circular core is bright white at the very center, but light yellow overall. Going outward, there are gaps between the rings. At 9 o’clock is a small dwarf galaxy. It is about the same size as the yellow core of the Bullseye. The dwarf galaxy is blue, with many dots. It looks like the edge of the Bullseye might touch the dwarf galaxy.

"Black Holes: Cooked. Ate. Left no crumbs.   Recent studies show that black holes in the universe can create their own meals. Data from our @nasachandraxray Observatory and the Very Large Telescope (VLT) provide new evidence that outbursts from black holes can help cool down gas to feed themselves.   The centers of galaxy clusters contain the universe’s most massive galaxies, which harbor huge black holes with masses ranging from millions to tens of billions of times that of the Sun. Jets from these black holes are driven by the black holes feasting on gas.   The latest research supports a model where outbursts from the black holes trigger hot gas to cool and form narrow filaments of warm gas. Some of the warm gas in these filaments should then flow into the centers of the galaxies to feed the black holes, causing an outburst. The outburst causes more gas to cool and feed the black holes, leading to further outbursts - a cosmic buffet!   Image descriptions: A swipe-through of different galaxy clusters, each with a central black hole surrounded by patches and filaments of gas. In each image, a patch of purple with neon pink veins floats in the blackness of space, surrounded by flecks of light. At the center of each patch is a glowing, bright white dot. The bright white dots represent black holes. The purple patches represent hot X-ray gas, and the neon pink veins represent filaments of warm gas.   In the image of the Perseus Cluster on the left, the surrounding flecks of light are larger and brighter, making the individual galaxies they represent easier to discern. The purple gas has a blue tint, and the hot pink filaments appear solid, as if rendered with quivering strokes of a paintbrush. The Centaurus Cluster is on the right; in this image, the purple gas appears softer, with a more diffuse quality. The filaments are rendered in more detail, with feathery edges, and range in color from pale pink to neon red.   Credit: (X-ray:) ASA/CXC/SAO/V.

"Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.  Released in 2019, this is the first image of a black hole and its shadow, which represents a historic feat by an international network of radio telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). A black hole is an extremely dense object from which no light can escape. Anything that comes within a black hole’s “event horizon,” its point of no return, will be consumed, never to re-emerge, because of the black hole’s unimaginably strong gravity. Not unlike the Black Lodge.  In this image, you can see the shadow of the supermassive black hole in the center of Messier 87 (M87), an elliptical galaxy some 55 million light-years from Earth. This black hole is 6.5 billion times the mass of the Sun. Catching its shadow involved eight ground-based radio telescopes around the globe, operating together as if they were one telescope the size of our entire planet.  In memory of David Lynch, we will continue to explore the otherworldly and the unknown. We will focus not on the loss, but on what we gained from the years we shared this planet with you. We will see you in our dreams.  Image description: Using the Event Horizon Telescope, scientists obtained this image of the black hole at the center of galaxy M87, outlined by emission from hot gas swirling around it under the influence of strong gravity near its event horizon.

"Nothing like a clear view⁣  ⁣ @NASAHubble captured an image of this previously unexplored globular cluster in the Milky Way, Palomar 8. A globular cluster is a collection of tens of thousands to millions of stars tightly bound together by gravity in a spherical shape – like a globe. Globular clusters generally form early in the galaxies’ histories in regions rich in gas and dust. Since the stars form from the same cloud of gas as it collapses, they typically hover around the same age.⁣  ⁣ The density of stars at the centers of these groupings is so high that individual stars are hard to discern, even with powerful telescopes on Earth. However, Hubble can! This image is part of a study that uses Hubble to distinguish individual stars of the entire globular cluster system of the Milky Way. These observations will give us key information on the early stages of our galaxy.⁣  ⁣ Image description: Bright stars cluster against a black background.

"Multiple fires have been burning in Los Angeles County since early January. Smoke plumes from the fires can be seen over the Pacific Ocean from space, visible in this @NOAA-20 satellite image from Jan. 9. Powerful Santa Ana winds and a lack of rain created “critical” fire weather conditions in Southern California, according to the @nws, contributing to the rapid spread of the fires.   As of Jan. 10, the Palisades Fire in California has burned nearly 20,000 acres. This fire, along with many others in the area, have forced evacuations in and around the Los Angeles area, including our @NASAJPL facility. Historically, California’s fire season runs from June or July through October or early November. The hot, dry conditions that drive fire season are now present longer into the winter, fueled by a warmer climate. NASA just confirmed 2024 was the hottest year on record.

"Planets: Let them cook!⁣ ⁣ A @NASAHubble study from 2003 suggested that the gigantic disks that gave rise to planets in the early universe were longer-lived than they should be, given the conditions of their environment. Old stars don’t have enough of the heavier elements that are necessary ingredients to form the planets. But how are they still able to cook at the ripe old age of 20 to 30 million years?⁣ ⁣ To answer this question, researchers used @NASAWebb to study stars in a nearby galaxy that, much like the early universe, lacks large amounts of heavy elements. The circles in the second image show the positions of the 10 stars surveyed.

"Sometimes you’ve got to bloom before you glow. 🌟   ...just like this rare Wolf-Rayet star did before going supernova. 15,000 light years away from the constellation Sagittarius, WR 124 shed its outer layers, resulting in halos of gas and dust that appear like a blooming flower—a fleeting phase that happens to only some stars before they explode.   In this composite image from @NASAChandraXray, @NASAWebb and WISE, WR 124 gleams as dozens of other bright stars surround it. X-rays from Chandra are colorized purple, while infrared frequencies captured from WISE are blue. Observations from Webb’s Near-Infrared and Mid-Infrared instruments are red, green, and blue.   The star itself is 30 times the mass of our Sun and has shed 10 Suns’ worth of material so far. As the gas moves away and cools, cosmic dust forms, showering astronomers with a deeper insight into a crucial period in the early history of our universe.

They’re surrounded by swirls of gas—the “pine needles” of the tree—with green representing light in the visible spectrum.In the first image, optical data (in green and violet) was captured by astrophotographer Michael Clow from his telescope in Arizona in November 2024. In the second image of the cluster, released in 2023, optical data (in green) was observed by the National Science Foundation’s WIYN 0.9-meter telescope on Kitt Peak in Arizona.The images have been rotated clockwise by about 160 degrees from the astronomer’s standard of North pointing upward, so that it appears like the top of the tree is toward the top of the image.Image descriptions:1. Wispy green clouds in a conical shape strongly resemble an evergreen tree. Tiny specks of white, blue, purple, and red light, stars within the cluster, dot the structure, turning the cloud into a festive, cosmic Christmas tree.2. Wispy green lines and shapes resemble the boughs and needles of an evergreen tree, with glowing lights of blue and white - stars within the cluster - scattered across it. The peak of the tree is at the top center of the image. Stars are seen in the foreground and background as gleaming specks of white light against the blackness of space.Credits: 1.

"A light in the dark ⭐⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Journey through the darkness of space to the constellation Aquila for a spectacular light show. This nebula, around 7,200 light-years away from Earth, is a hotbed of high-mass star formation. The stars that are born here are so massive that they will eventually become supernovae. Still, as they form, they shape their surroundings: the protostar at the center of the image sends out a jet of material toward us.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ This picture was taken with @NASAHubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 as part of research that measured the extent of ionization in the jets coming from the protostar within this nebula. Ionization is the process by which atoms or molecules become charged, often because they are in such a high-energy environment that they have lost some of their electrons.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Image description: On the left side of the image, we can see the dark nebula, with some dust clouds faintly lit by nearby stars.

"Stars sparkle into life ✨  This glittering cluster of 3,000 stars is known as Westerlund 2, named for the Swedish astronomer, Bengt Westerlund, who discovered it. This star cluster is between 6 to 13 light-years across, and is ""only"" about 2 million years old—a very long time for us, but a blink of an eye for a star.   Because this star cluster is so young, many of its stars have not yet ignited the hydrogen in their cores; the red dots scattered throughout this image are newly-forming stars, still wrapped in their gas-and-dust cocoons.

"Stars / In your multitudes / Scarce to be counted✨⁣  ⁣ NASA astronaut @astro_pettit used a homemade tracking device to capture this starfield from a window on the SpaceX Dragon crew spacecraft docked to the International Space Station.⁣  ⁣ To get a stellar view like this, Pettit took a 25-second-long exposure with an ISO (camera light sensitivity) of 3200. With a longer exposure – that is, leaving the camera’s shutter open for a longer period of time – more light falls on the camera’s sensor. On top of that, the cameras the astronauts often use are designed to be more sensitive in low-light situations. All this means they’re more likely to capture bright stars in their images.⁣  ⁣ Images of the Earth from orbit are typically taken with exposures just right to image the bright planet, but too short to record many stars, which are far dimmer in comparison.⁣  ⁣ Image description: Looking through an oval, we can see space blanketed by white stars.

"It’s MY turn to shine.   Several million young stars are vying for attention in this @NASAHubble image of a star-forming nebula called 30 Doradus, or the Tarantula Nebula. At the time of release (April 16, 2012), this was one of the largest mosaic images ever assembled from Hubble photos; this image is roughly 650 light-years across!   Located 170,000 light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 30 Doradus is pretty stellar – pun fully intended. It’s the brightest star-forming region in our galactic neighborhood, it’s home to the most massive stars ever seen, and no known star-forming region in our galaxy is as large or as prolific.   See the clouds of gas and dust at bottom left that almost look like waves you’d see at the beach? They were carved into that shape because of the ultraviolet light released by massive stars. In addition to sculpting the material around them, these brilliant stars may also be triggering new waves of star birth: when the ultraviolet radiation hits dense walls of gas, it creates shocks, which may create a new generation of offspring.   Image description: This turbulent scene of star birth takes shape in shades of deep blue, brownish red, and white. Millions of stars, some bigger and brighter than others, dot the landscape.

"All that is glitters is not gold…   But it may still be a galaxy. This sparkling field is Abell 2125, a galaxy cluster located 3 billion light-years away from us in the Ursa Minor constellation. Each golden yellow dot you see is an individual galaxy, captured in visible light by the Kitt Peak National Observatory. The purple dots and haze are gas clouds seen in X-ray light by @NASAChandraXray. X-rays are not part of the visible light spectrum, so they've been translated into color we can see in this image.   It takes billions of years to build a massive galaxy cluster like Abell 2125, which may contain thousands of galaxies. Since it’s so far away, this cluster also gives us insight into the early stages of galaxy cluster development, as well as the effects on galaxies within it. For example, data from Chandra, @NASAHubble, and the Very Large Array show that several galaxies in Abell 2125 are being stripped of their gas as they fall through hot, high-pressure clouds.

In this photo from 2002, NASA astronaut David Wolf is riding the Canadarm2 robotic arm as he installs a camera on the outside of the International Space Station. Wolf visited the @ISS on NASA's STS-112 mission, which sent a crew of six to the station aboard space shuttle Atlantis.  There have been over 270 spacewalks outside the International Space Station since 1998, setting up new experiments, swapping out hardware, and otherwise keeping the orbiting laboratory ship-shape. As we work to grow humanity's presence in low Earth orbit, we're supporting the development of new orbiting destinations—so your next spacewalk may be closer than you think.

"There's no place like (our) home (galaxy) 🌌  Astronomers estimate that our universe could hold up to 2 trillion galaxies—but the Milky Way is the only one known, so far, to support life.   The Milky Way is about 100,000 light-years wide, with roughly 200 billion stars packed within its twin spiral arms. Our Sun, and solar system, are about halfway from the Milky Way's center—which is why you can see the galaxy shining in the night sky if you're far from cities and bright lights.  This image of the Milky Way was captured at the @nationalparkservice's Dinosaur National Monument, located in Colorado and Utah.

"Full moon tonight!  Friday, Nov. 15, is a great opportunity to see our fourth supermoon in a row—and the last one of 2024. November's full moon is sometimes called the Beaver Moon: November is when beavers prepare for the winter by fortifying dams and stocking their food supply.  A supermoon takes place when the full moon is near perigee, its closest point to Earth: a distance of about 226,000 miles, or 364,000 kilometers. When the full moon is at its furthest distance from Earth—about 253,000 miles (407,000 km), its apogee—it's sometimes known as a micromoon.

"Tiny but mighty 💪  Saturn ice moon Mimas wears its history on its surface. The tiny moon – only 247 miles (397 km) across – is covered in impact craters dating from the turbulent beginnings of our solar system.   Its most distinguishing feature is a giant impact crater named Herschel (not shown here), after the English astronomer who discovered Mimas in 1789. Shock waves from the Herschel impact may have caused the fractures, also called chasmata, on the opposite side of Mimas.   Puzzlingly, Mimas appears to be frozen solid. Mimas is closer to Saturn and has a much more elongated orbit than Enceladus, another of Saturn’s icy moons, so it should have more tidal heating than Enceladus. Yet Enceladus has geysers of water, which implies internal heat, while Mimas has one of the most heavily cratered surfaces in the solar system, which suggests a frozen surface that has lasted long enough to preserve all those craters.   This paradox has prompted the ""Mimas Test"" – any theory that claims to explain Enceladus’ partially thawed water must also explain Mimas’ entirely frozen water.   Image description: Mimas, a small moon with a heavily cratered surface, is in sharp focus against the hazy edge of Saturn’s atmosphere. Half of Mimas is visible, while the right side is in shadow.

"Put down the air guitar, pick up the space guitar 🎸🔥⁣  ⁣ A flame-throwing nebula shreds its way across the universe in this video from our @NASAChandraXray and @NASAHubble telescopes. Astronomers nicknamed this structure the Guitar Nebula because of the guitar-shaped bubbles streaming out from the pulsar in the lower left. (Don’t see the guitar? Swipe through for a hint.)⁣  ⁣ Meanwhile, X-rays seen by Chandra (displayed here in red) show a filament of energetic matter and antimatter particles blasting away from the pulsar; this red line is about two light-years (12 trillion miles or 18 trillion km) long. This rapidly-rotating, fast-moving star has a very strong magnetic field, which helps create the strange shapes shown in this video.⁣  ⁣ Video description: A six-second multiwavelength timelapse video of the Guitar Nebula. The guitar shape appears at the lower left, with the neck of the instrument pointing towards the upper left. The guitar shape is ghostly and translucent, resembling a wispy cloud on a dark night. At the end of the neck, the guitar’s head comes to a sharp point that lands on a bright, white dot. This dot is a pulsar, and the guitar shape is a hydrogen nebula.⁣  ⁣ The pulsar has also released an energetic X-ray blast that extends from the bright white dot all the way out to the upper righthand corner of the frame.

"Hats off to you!This new infrared image from @NASAWebb shows off bespoke details in the Sombrero galaxy, a hat-like formation around 30 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Virgo.When previously imaged by @NASAHubble in visible light, the core of the galaxy shone bright, obscuring the inner disk, but here, we can see that the inner disk is smooth. Webb’s new view also reveals that the outer ring is made of intricate clumps of dust. Researchers say the clumpy nature of the dust can indicate the presence of young star-forming regions.We usually feature rather turbulent parts of the universe, but the Sombrero galaxy is rather peaceful in comparison. It’s not particularly active in terms of star creation: it produces less than one solar mass of stars per year, in comparison to the Milky Way’s roughly two solar masses a year. Even the supermassive black hole at the center of the Sombrero galaxy is rather docile. It’s classified as a low luminosity active galactic nucleus, slowly snacking on infalling material from the galaxy while sending off a bright, relatively small, jet.Image description: A wide view of the Sombrero galaxy is split into three slides. Seen edge-on, it looks like a flat blue disk at an angle. In the first slide, the clumps of dust that make up the outer ring take center stage. On the second slide, the bright core and smooth inner ring are visible. Finally, the lumpy outer ring reappears in slide three. On each slide, distant galaxies dot the background, appearing as multicolored dots in the darkness of space.

"Excuse me. 🤭⁣  ⁣ On Aug. 31, 2012, the Sun let out quite a burp. A long filament of solar material erupted out from the Sun's atmosphere, or corona, into space. This coronal mass ejection (CME) was captured in different ultraviolet light wavelengths by our Solar Dynamics Observatory, a spacecraft that studies solar activity and space weather. This photo combines those images to give us a detailed view of the solar event.⁣  ⁣ This CME traveled at over 900 miles per second (1450 kps), connecting with Earth's magnetic environment. When the particles released during a CME interact with gases in Earth’s magnetosphere, beautiful displays of light in the sky appear: auroras.⁣  ⁣ Auroras happen more often and more strongly when the Sun is at its peak activity level in its 11-year cycle, called solar maximum. You may have guessed that we’re currently in this peak activity period, given we’ve been able to see auroras several times this year. If you scroll back through our feed, you’ll see a few photos of them.⁣  ⁣ We’ll be sure to let you know when there’s another great opportunity to see an aurora. In the meantime, here are some viewing tips to keep in mind for the next time.  1. Check the weather forecast. You’ll need clear skies to best see the phenomenon.⁣  2. Go to a safe, dark location. Strong auroras can be seen even in big cities, but the best views will be in areas with little or no light pollution.⁣  3. Be patient! While displays can last all night, sometimes they are much shorter-lived, and they can vary in brightness throughout the night.⁣  Check out the link in our bio for more tips!⁣  ⁣ Image description: The Sun appears as a bright, fiery red and orange ball.

"Meet Callisto 🌕  The third-largest moon in the solar system—almost as big as the planet Mercury—Callisto was first spotted orbiting Jupiter in 1610 by the astronomer Galileo Galilei. Callisto has been pummeled by comets and asteroids for 4 billion years, shaping its rocky, icy surface. Scientists think that, like fellow moon Europa, Callisto could hold a massive ocean underneath.  Much of what we know about Callisto comes from a @NASASolarSystem spacecraft named (appropriately) Galileo, which orbited Jupiter and studied its moons from 1995 to 2003. Galileo captured this image of Callisto in May 2001, two years before the spacecraft ended its mission with a dramatic plunge into Jupiter's crushing atmosphere.  Image description: The moon of Callisto, a spherical, mottled ball, as seen from space. Its dark, brownish surface is covered with craters of various sizes and white marks, which are thought to be crater peaks capped with ice. The background of the photo is completely black.

"Red Wine Supernova ❤️  Since its discovery in 1987, this supernova has fascinated astronomers with its spectacular light show. Located in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud, it was the nearest supernova explosion observed in hundreds of years and the best opportunity yet for astronomers to study the phases before, during, and after the death of a star.  This supernova has been studied by @NASAHubble, @nasachandraxray, and ALMA, a powerful array of 66 antennas, for over 30 years. Here are a few things they showed us, so slow down, sit down, it's new:  - Hubble studies revealed that the dense ring of gas around the supernova (visible at the very center of the image) has a diameter of about a light-year and glows in optical light. The ring was there at least 20,000 years before the star exploded. A flash of ultraviolet light from the explosion energized the gas in the ring, making it glow for decades.  - Chandra data showed an expanding ring of X-ray emission that had been steadily getting brighter from 1993 to 2013. The blast wave from the original explosion has been bursting through and heating the ring of gas surrounding the supernova, producing X-rays.  - Beginning in 2012, astronomers used ALMA to observe the glowing remains of the supernova, studying how the remnant is actually making vast amounts of new dust. A portion of this dust will make its way into interstellar space and may become the building blocks of future stars and planets in another system. These observations also suggest that dust in the early universe likely formed from similar supernova explosions.  Image description: Clouds of gas and dust in shades of red cover the top of the image and a little bit of the bottom. Right in the middle is Supernova 1987a, the remnant of an exploded star. The site of the supernova is surrounded by an illuminated pinkish ring. Two faint outer rings are also visible. Stars and galaxies shine throughout, giving off red and blue light.

"On the tails of a comet ☄️⁣  ⁣ Astronaut Matthew Dominick took this photo of comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS on Sept. 22, when it was about 100 million miles (160 million km) from Earth. Dominick captured this shot aboard the International Space Station (@ISS) using long-duration photography on a camera programmed for high sensitivity. The comet, which likely traveled from the outer reaches of our solar system, made its closest transit past the Sun on Sept. 27.⁣  ⁣ When a comet approaches the Sun, it gets warmer. Heat causes its ice to sublimate into gas, and these gases and dust become a glowing head and tail that can extend millions of miles. The dust tail of Tsuchinshan-ATLAS features prominently in this photo, extending toward the top of the frame.⁣  ⁣ A second type of tail, the ion tail, is faintly visible, pointing down and to the right. The Sun influences the two types of tails in different ways, often sending them in different directions. The heat and pressure of sunlight push particles in the dust tail away from the Sun, though the tail may bend slightly in the direction the comet came from. Likewise, the solar wind strips ions off of the comet’s surface to create the ion tail, which may extend at a different angle.⁣  ⁣ Image description: A comet appears to shoot down the center of the image, with a cross-section view of the Earth’s horizon and atmospheric layers below.

"Behold: a full moon worthy of the Halloween season. The Hunter’s Moon!⁣ ⁣ According to the Farmer’s Almanac, this month’s full moon coincides with deer hunting season. This Hunter’s Moon is extra special this year because it is also a supermoon, which means that the full moon occurs when the Moon is closest to Earth in its elliptical orbit.⁣ ⁣ At its closest point, the full moon can appear up to 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than the faintest Moon of the year, which occurs when it’s farthest from Earth in its orbit. Even though 14 percent doesn’t make a big difference in detectable size, a full supermoon is a bit brighter than other moons throughout the year.⁣ ⁣ This full moon is also important to lots of different cultures across the world. As the full moon in the Hebrew month of Tishrei, this full moon falls near the start of Sukkoth, a seven-day holiday starting on the fifteenth day of the month. For Hindus, this is Sharad Purnima, also known as Kumara Purnima, Kojagari Purnima, Navanna Purnima Kojagrat Purnima, or Kaumudi Purnima. For Buddhists, this full moon marks the end of Vassa, the three-month period of fasting for monks tied to the monsoons. In Myanmar, this full moon corresponds with the three-day Thadingyut Festival of Lights, also known as the Lighting Festival of Myanmar. In Sri Lanka, this is Vap Poya, which is followed by the Kathina festival, during which people give gifts to the monks.⁣ ⁣ Keep an eye on the sky for the next couple days, as the Moon will appear full through the morning of Friday, Oct. 18.⁣  Image description: The full moon glows bright gold in the top left of the image.

"If you look closely … you might find …⁣  ⁣ Uranus, pictured as a blue dot in the upper left of this natural-colored image, represents what the human eye would see from the vantage point of our Cassini spacecraft as it flew by Saturn’s rings. At the time, Cassini was approximately 614,300 miles (988,600 km) from Saturn and 28.3 astronomical units from Uranus. An astronomical unit is the average distance from Earth to the Sun, equal to 93 million miles (150 million km).⁣  ⁣ Uranus is a pale blue because its visible atmosphere contains methane gas, and few aerosols or clouds. Methane on Uranus – and its sapphire-colored sibling, Neptune – absorbs red wavelengths of incoming sunlight, but allows blue wavelengths to escape back into space, resulting in the predominantly bluish color seen here.⁣  ⁣ Image description: Several of Saturn’s rings diagonally intersect the image from the right corner.

"Take a deep breath...  X-ray images from our Chandra X-ray Observatory helped astronomers confirm that most of the oxygen in the universe is synthesized in massive stars. So, everybody say ""thank you"" to supernova remnants (SNRs) like this one, which has enough oxygen for thousands of solar systems.  Supernova remnants are, naturally, the remains of exploded stars. They're extremely important for understanding our galaxy. If it weren't for SNRs, there would be no Earth, no plants, animals, or people. This is because all the elements heavier than iron were made in a supernova explosion, so the only reason we find these elements on Earth or in our solar system — or any other extrasolar planetary system — is because those elements were formed during a supernova.  @nasachandraxray's data is represented in this image by blue and purple, while optical data from @nasahubble and the Very Large Telescope in Chile are in red and green.

"It’s giving rainbows and unicorns, like a middle school binder 🦄🌈 ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Meet NGC 602, a young star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud (one of our satellite galaxies), where astronomers using @NASAWebb have found candidates for the first brown dwarfs outside of our galaxy.  This star cluster has a similar environment to the kinds of star-forming regions that would have existed in the early universe—with very low amounts of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. It’s drastically different from our own solar neighborhood and close enough to study in detail. ⁣⁣  ⁣⁣ Brown dwarfs are… not quite stars, but also not quite gas giant planets either. Typically they range from about 13 to 75 Jupiter masses. They are sometimes free-floating and not gravitationally bound to a star, like a planet would be. But they do share some characteristics with exoplanets, like storm patterns and atmospheric composition. ⁣⁣  @NASAHubble showed us that NGC 602 harbors some very young low-mass stars; Webb is showing us how significant and extensive objects like brown dwarfs are in this cluster.

"A supernova glowing in the dark 🌟⁣  ⁣ When supernova remnant SN 1006 first appeared in the sky in 1006 C.E., it was far brighter than Venus and visible during the daytime for weeks. From that moment on, it occupied the hearts of astronomers all over the world; it has been studied from the ground and from space many times.⁣  ⁣ In this image, visible, radio, and X-ray data combine to give us that blue (and red) view of the remnant’s full shell – the debris field that was created when a white dwarf star exploded and sent material hurtling into space.⁣  ⁣ Scientists believe SN 1006 is a Type Ia supernova. This class of supernova is caused when a white dwarf never lets another star go: either it pulls too much mass from a companion star and explodes, or it merges with another white dwarf and explodes. Understanding Type Ia supernovas is especially important because astronomers use observations of these explosions in distant galaxies as mileposts to mark the expansion of the universe.⁣  ⁣ Image description: This supernova remnant looks like a bubble filled with blue and red clouds of dust and gas, floating amid a million stars.

"Eye see you… 👁  Back in 1996, @NASAHubble revealed the hourglass shape of this young planetary nebula located about 8,000 light-years away. In previous images taken from the ground, the nebula looked like a pair of large outer rings with a smaller central one, but the finer details could not be seen.  Planetary nebulae are created by the death of Sun-like stars: the star collapses to form a dense and hot white dwarf star. At the same time, the dying star throws off its outer layers of material, forming an elaborate cloud of gas and dust known as a planetary nebula. This isn’t an uncommon phenomenon, and yet, this “eye” star is a little unique: it should be at the center of the nebula, but it’s off center.  Hubble also revealed other new and unexpected features in the nebula. For example, there is a pair of intersecting elliptical rings in the central region, which appear to be the rims of a smaller hourglass. There are also the intricate patterns of the etchings on the hourglass walls. There are a few possible explanations for the arc-like etchings – for instance, they could be the remnants of shells ejected from the star when it was younger.  This picture was composed of three separate images taken by Hubble’s Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 in the light of ionized nitrogen (represented by red), hydrogen (green), and doubly ionized oxygen (blue).  Image description: This nebula has an interesting appearance: what looks like a turquoise blue eye stares right at you from the center of a red-orange hourglass-like shape made from two interlocking circles – like a Venn diagram turned on its side. The circles each have arcs within them. The darkness of space forms the backdrop of this image.

"“The sun goes burp and the atmosphere turns red.”  So said NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who captured the aurora from the @ISS on Oct. 10, 2024. He and fellow NASA astronaut Matthew Dominick were just about to call it a day and get some sleep, having been unsuccessful in getting a good view of the aurora, when they looked through the cupola windows and realized they were flying in the aurora, not above it.  Auroras are usually created when the Sun sends a surge of charged particles – the “burp” – through solar flares, coronal mass ejections, or an active solar wind toward Earth. Those solar particles collide with the magnetosphere and compress it, changing the configuration of Earth’s magnetic field. Some particles trapped in the magnetic field are accelerated into Earth’s upper atmosphere where they excite nitrogen and oxygen molecules and release photons of light – the aurora.  Since the space station became operational in November 2000, crew members have produced hundreds of thousands of images of Earth and natural events like auroras. Their photographs record how the planet changes over time, allowing scientists to study phenomena, monitor disasters, and direct response on the ground.  Image description: Behind modules of the International Space Station is the aurora, a green and red haze curving over Earth.

"Get pulled in…  This image of a pair of galaxies – one elliptical (left) and the other spiral (right) – reveals something special: the supermassive black hole at the center of the large spiral galaxy. As the black hole gobbles up surrounding gas and dust, that material heats up and lets out a tremendous amount of energy, making the galaxy’s core shine brightly. The black hole also displays @NASAWebb’s characteristic diffraction spikes, caused by the light emitted interacting with the structure of the telescope itself.  Webb observed this galactic pair collectively known as Arp 107 with two instruments, MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) and NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera), that observe different light wavelengths. Each wavelength offers unique insights into the structure of Arp 107. This image comes from MIRI.  Image description: A pair of interacting galaxies. The larger of the two galaxies is slightly right of center, and is composed of a bright, white center and a ring of blue, gaseous filaments. The center of this galaxy shows Webb’s eight-pronged diffraction pattern. There are three filaments of gas and dust moving from the ring toward the center. At the top left of the ring is a noticeable gap, bordered by two large, blue pockets of dust and gas. The smaller galaxy is made of hazy, light blue gas and dust. Many red, green, blue, and yellow galaxies are spread throughout, with some being hazier in composition and others having more defined spiral patterns.

"Don’t cross the streams! 👻  ⁣ Thankfully, it wasn’t as bad as the Ghostbusters feared. Astronomers using @NASAChandraXray found a galaxy cluster that has two streams of superheated gas crossing one another, which may lead to the creation of new structure.⁣  ⁣ Researchers discovered an enormous, comet-like tail of hot gas — spanning over 1.6 million light-years long — trailing behind a galaxy within the galaxy cluster called Zwicky 8338 (Z8338 for short). As the galaxy hurtled through space, its tail split into two streams.⁣  ⁣ This is the second pair of tails trailing behind a galaxy in this system. Previously, astronomers discovered a shorter pair of tails from a different galaxy near this latest one.

"If you got it, flaunt it 🔥  This stylish sphere, spotted by @NASAHubble, is known as the Bubble Nebula. Residing 7,100 light-years from Earth, the Bubble Nebula itself is a whopping 7 light-years across. The seething star that forms this nebula is 45 times more massive than our Sun!  Gas on the star gets so hot that it escapes away into space as a stellar wind moving at over four million miles per hour (6.4 million kph). The gases, heated to varying temperatures, emit different colors: blue for oxygen, green for hydrogen, and red for nitrogen.  The Bubble Nebula formed about four million years ago—and in 10 to 20 million years, the star at its core will likely detonate as a supernova.

"The dangers of bottling up your emotions ⚠️ ⁣  ⁣ In the binary star system at the middle of this image, a white dwarf swings by its red giant companion once every 44 years. When it gets too close, it siphons off hydrogen gas, which builds and builds until it undergoes spontaneous nuclear fusion – causing an explosion like a hydrogen bomb. The dwarf star’s outburst ejects geyser-like filaments from its core, forming weird loops and trails as the plasma emerges in streamers.⁣  ⁣ The plasma is twisted by the force of the explosion, channeled upwards and outwards by strong magnetic fields until it appears to bend back on itself into a spiral pattern.

"You’re gonna hear me roar  Have no fear: what might look like a nightmarish beast throwing its head back in an angry red sea is just a pillar of gas and dust. The Cone Nebula is 2,500 light-years away in the constellation Monoceros. This image, captured by @NASAHubble, shows the upper 2.5 light-years of the nebula; the entire nebula is 7 light-years long. Monstrous pillars of cold gas like the Cone are common in large regions of star birth. Astronomers believe the pillars are incubators for developing stars.  Over millions of years, radiation from hot, young stars (located beyond the top of the image) has slowly eroded the nebula. This process causes the hydrogen gas to glow, which produces the red halo of light seen around the pillar. A similar process occurs on a much smaller scale to gas surrounding a single star, forming the bow-shaped arc seen near the upper left side of the Cone. Eventually, only the densest regions of the Cone will be left. Inside these regions, stars and planets may form.

"Blink and you’ll miss it 👀  The bright star taking center stage is a Wolf-Rayet star known as WR 31a, located about 30,000 light-years away in the constellation of Carina (The Keel). Wolf-Rayet stars, named after astronomers Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet who discovered the first of these stars, are extremely hot and massive. Some can be around 20 times as massive as the Sun! However, their lifecycle is only a few hundred thousand years. In cosmic terms, that’s like the blink of an eye.  Wolf–Rayet stars typically lose half their mass in less than 100,000 years, and WR 31a is no exception. It will eventually end its life as a spectacular supernova, and the stellar material expelled from its explosion will later nourish a new generation of stars and planets.  The blue bubble that looks like it’s surrounding WR 31a and its unnamed companion is a Wolf-Rayet nebula. These typically round or ring-shaped interstellar clouds of dust and gas are created when speedy winds interact with the outer layers of hydrogen ejected by Wolf–Rayet stars.

"C is for craters, that's good enough for me 👀   On Oct. 12, 2012, our MESSENGER spacecraft captured this targeted observation of a small area of Mercury's surface, where two smaller craters on the rim of a larger crater resemble a pair of eyes.  MESSENGER was first spacecraft to visit Mercury in 30 years, and the first ever to orbit. The spacecraft mapped the entire planet, discovered abundant water ice in shadows at the poles, and unlocked knowledge about Mercury's geology and magnetic field.   The mission spent a little over four years orbiting Mercury, sending back nearly 300,000 photographs and a wealth of information from its instruments. MESSENGER's mission came to an end on April 30, 2015.   The planet Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon, and has a solid, cratered surface. It's the fastest planet in our solar system – traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second.

"Stellar Soup of the Day⁣  ⁣ The cosmic concoction @NASAWebb has spotted here is a nebula in the Perseus molecular cloud, located approximately 960 light-years away.⁣  ⁣ Webb’s sensitive scopes can reveal cosmic objects with extremely low masses. Some of the faintest “stars” in the picture are, in fact, newly born free-floating brown dwarfs with masses comparable to those of giant planets. The gas and dust that surround these young stars are part of the ingredients that may eventually produce planetary systems.⁣  ⁣ This is not a new recipe. Like the young stars in this image, our own Sun and planets formed inside a dusty molecular cloud 4.6 billion years ago. Our Sun didn’t form by itself: it was part of a cluster much more massive than the nebula seen here.

"Count the headlights on the highway... ✨  If you were living in this “super star” cluster, you might see a sky full of hundreds of stars, each as bright as the full moon.   This is @NASAWebb’s look at Westerlund 1, one of the closest clusters of its kind. Super star clusters are young and contain more than 10,000 times the mass of the Sun packed into a small volume. Westerlund 1 is the most massive yet identified in our galaxy, with 50,000 to 100,000 times the mass of the Sun contained within a region less than six light-years across. Still considered an open cluster now, someday it will evolve into a globular cluster—a roughly spherical, tightly packed collection of old stars bound together by gravity.   Super star clusters are one of the most extreme environments in which stars and planets can form. Because our galaxy is past its peak of star formation, and because stars live relatively short lives, only a few of these clusters still exist to give us clues to that past era.   Westerlund 1 has a large, dense, and diverse population of evolved, massive stars. It contains so many massive stars that in a timespan of less than 40 million years, it’ll be the site of more than 1500 supernovas. This cluster is a natural laboratory for the study of extreme stellar physics, helping us learn how the most massive stars in our galaxy live and die, and how stellar winds, supernovae, and other ejected material affect star formation within their environment.   Read more at the link in @ESAWebb’s bio.   Image description: A dense cluster of bright stars, each with six large and two small diffraction spikes, due to the telescope’s optics.

"Sometimes you need to eat an entire stream of dust thousands of light-years long.⁣ ⁣ Let us show you the best way to do it! In these images from our retired Spitzer Space Telescope, the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Andromeda galaxy consumes streams of gas and dust. ⁣ ⁣ As supermassive black holes “eat,” material heats up just before it falls in, creating incredible light shows — sometimes brighter than an entire galaxy full of stars. But the black hole at the center of Andromeda (one of our nearest galactic neighbors) is a “quiet” eater, meaning that the little light it emits does not vary significantly in brightness. This suggests that it is consuming a small but steady flow of material, rather than large clumps. ⁣ ⁣ Launched in 2003 and managed by @NASAJPL, Spitzer studied the universe in infrared light, which is invisible to human eyes. Different wavelengths reveal different features of Andromeda, including hotter sources of light, like stars, and cooler sources, like dust. ⁣ ⁣ And MSG, obviously.⁣ ⁣ Image description: A two-slide image of the Andromeda galaxy.

"The ice must flow   In the frigid waters of Foxe Basin near Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic, chunks of sea ice drift through swirls of grease ice, creating patterns that remind us of the clouds of gas and dust we see throughout the universe.   Sea ice often starts out as grease ice, a soupy layer of tiny ice crystals on the ocean's surface. While there’s no oil involved, grease ice makes the ocean look slick. As the temperature drops, grease ice thickens and merges into slabs of more solid ice.   Changing ice, ocean, and atmospheric conditions in the northernmost part of Earth have a large impact on the entire planet because the Arctic region acts like Earth’s air conditioner. Much of the Sun’s energy is transported from tropical regions of our planet by winds and weather systems into the Arctic where it is then lost to space. This process helps cool the planet.   Landsat 7, a NASA/@USGS satellite, captured this image back on Aug. 4, 2002. Landsat 7 stopped collecting science images in January 2024, but we continue to study sea ice in other ways. Most recently, three aircraft flew over the Arctic Ocean north of Greenland, gathering observations of surface sea ice, clouds, and aerosol particles in a NASA-sponsored mission.

"The ghosts of galaxies past👻   Four billion light-years away, inside an immense collection of nearly 500 galaxies nicknamed “Pandora’s Cluster,” @NASAHubble found the faint, ghostly light of wandering stars.   These stars are no longer bound to any one galaxy, and drift freely between galaxies in the cluster. By observing the light from the orphaned stars, Hubble astronomers assembled evidence that suggests as many as six galaxies were torn to pieces inside the cluster over a stretch of 6 billion years.   Scientists have long hypothesized that the light from scattered stars should be detectable after galaxies are disassembled, but the predicted glow of stars is very faint and a challenge to identify. However, these extremely faint stars are brightest at near-infrared wavelengths of light, which Hubble can detect. Learning more about this “ghost light” is an important step in understanding the evolution of galaxy clusters.   Image description: Hundreds of galaxies are bathed in blue starlight.

"These stars are heavy metal 🤘   That is, they’ve got much higher proportions of metals – elements heavier than hydrogen or helium – than stars found in similar clusters. This glittery field is a 10-billion-year-old globular cluster, NGC 6496, and the stars within it are quite special. Not only do they have high metallicity, but some of them are also variable stars. This means that their brightness varies over time.   NGC 6496 hosts some long-period variables – giant pulsating stars whose brightness can take up to, and even over, a thousand days to change – and short-period eclipsing binaries, which dim when eclipsed by a stellar companion.   The way these stars’ brightness changes can reveal a lot about their mass, radius, luminosity, temperature, composition, and evolution, providing astronomers with measurements that would be difficult or even impossible to obtain through other methods.

"Looking good, feline great 🐱   Though the Cat’s Eye nebula (NGC 6543) was one of the first planetary nebulae to be discovered, it is one of the meow-st complex ones ever seen. @nasahubble captured its complexities in great detail here, highlighting a bullseye pattern of eleven or more concentric rings, or shells. Each ‘ring’ is actually the edge of a spherical bubble seen projected onto the sky. Observations suggest the star ejected its mass in a series of pulses at 1,500-year intervals. These convulsions created dust shells, each of which contain as much mass as all the planets in our solar system combined.   Planetary nebulae are one cat-egory of nebulae. They got their name because when they were first observed through early telescopes, they resembled planets. However, a planetary nebula is the final stage in the evolution of a star that is similar to our Sun.   Several explanations have been proposed for the bullseye patterns seen around planetary nebulae like the Cat’s Eye, including: cycles of magnetic activity somewhat like the Sun's sunspot cycle; the action of a companion star orbiting around the dying star; and stellar pulsations. Another school of thought is that the material is ejected smoothly from the star, and the rings are created later due to waves forming in the outflowing material. Further observations and more theoretical studies are needed to decide between these and other purr-tential explanations.   Image description: A nebula that is shaped like a cat’s eye. There is a bright pinpoint of light at the center. As you move outward from the center, there are bubbles of dust; the centermost one is blue. These shells appear as concentric rings at the edges of the nebula, looking much like the layers of an onion cut in half.

"Watashi wa star ✨   This light-year-long knot of interstellar gas and dust that looks a little like a caterpillar is a newborn star – a protostar.   Stars form in large clouds of gas and dust called molecular clouds. These massive clouds are cold and clump up. Eventually, gravity causes some of these clumps to collapse. When this happens, friction causes the material to heat up, eventually leading to the creation of a protostar.   A protostar hasn’t yet developed the energy-generating capabilities of a star like the Sun, which fuses hydrogen into helium in its core. Instead, a protostar’s energy comes from the heat released created by that initial collapse. In time, the protostar will develop the ability to generate energy like other Sun-like stars.

"“One small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.” - Astronaut Neil Armstrong   Fifty-five years ago today, America captured the world’s attention when our Apollo 11 mission landed on the Moon and astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first to walk on the lunar surface.   Today we are reminded how @NASA changed the world during the early era of space exploration. As we look toward the future and prepare for @NASAArtemis astronauts to take the next steps on the Moon, we remember the courage of the Apollo astronauts and their scientific discovery that lit the way forward.

The Apollo 11 mission, the first crewed lunar mission, launched from @NASAKennedy in Florida on a Saturn V launch vehicle on July 16, 1969, and safely returned to Earth on July 24, 1969.  The Saturn V vehicle produced a wave of flames as it rose from its pad at Launch Complex 39A. The 363-foot (approx. 110 m) tall, 6,400,000-pound (~2,900,000 kg) rocket hurled the spacecraft into orbit and then placed it on the trajectory to the Moon for humanity’s first lunar landing.  Aboard the spacecraft were astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, commander; Michael Collins, Command Module pilot; and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., Lunar Module pilot.

"Pose for the camera now, flick flick   Astronauts on the @ISS snapped this photo of the waning gibbous moon on Nov. 30, 2023, as they orbited 262 miles above the Swiss Alps. The Moon enters the waning gibbous phase after the full moon phase. As the Moon begins its journey back toward the Sun, the lighted side appears to shrink, but the Moon’s orbit is simply carrying it out of view from our perspective.   While astronauts observe and photograph the Moon from space, you can do the same on Earth! Here are a few tips: 1. Planning is key – scout out your photo location during the day, and practice using your camera. 2. Know when and where to look for the Moon (we have resources, hint hint). 3. Zoom in – the Moon often looks much bigger to the eye than it does in photographs, so zoom in as much as you can, especially if you’re using a smartphone.  Check out more tips at https://go.nasa.gov/snapthemoon.   You can even hear from the pros: At 4:05 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, July 24, astronauts Don Pettit and Matthew Dominick will talk about astrophotography in low Earth orbit on our NASA X account (formerly Twitter).

"Get in – we’re going on a roadtrip!   Light is our highway, and we’re coasting through the cosmos to visit four stunning destinations. Hop in and let @NASAWebb and @NASAChandraXray lead the way!   The first stop on this tour is the closest, at about 390 light-years away. Rho Opiuchi is a popular place for astronomers to study stars. X-rays from Chandra are purple, revealing infant stars that flare and produce X-rays. Infrared data from Webb are red, yellow, cyan, and blue.   Next is the Orion Nebula: this region is a bit farther, about 1,500 light-years away. Chandra reveals young stars that glow brightly in X-rays, colored here in red, green, and blue, while Webb shows the gas and dust (in darker red) that will help build the galaxy's next set of stars.   Exiting the Milky Way, our next destination is a spiral galaxy seen at a slight angle. X-rays from Chandra in purple show evidence for a supermassive black hole in its center, while Webb finds the dust, gas, and stars throughout the galaxy in red, green, and blue. This image also contains optical data from @NASAHubble in red, green, and blue.   Our final stop is the farthest and biggest! MACS J0416 is a galaxy cluster, one of the largest objects in the Universe held together by gravity. Galaxy clusters can contain hundreds or thousands of individual galaxies, all immersed in massive amounts of superheated gas. Chandra’s X-rays in purple show this reservoir of hot gas, while Hubble and Webb show the individual galaxies in red, green, and blue.   Credit:  1. (X-ray) NASA/CXC/MIT/C.

"Thinking about settling down? You're just like sediment.   Landsat 5, an Earth-observing satellite, captured this natural color image of the middle portion of the Mergui Archipelago on Dec. 14, 2004. The archipelago in the Andaman Sea is made up of more than 800 islands surrounded by extensive coral reefs.   Sediments in the rivers, seen at top middle, make them appear nearly white. As those sediments slowly settle out and are deposited on the seafloor, they make swirling patterns in the near-shore waters. They settle more as you move away from the shore, returning the water to a deep blue color.   Landsat 5 launched on March 1, 1984, and was decommissioned on June 5, 2013, far outliving its three-year design life. The satellite orbited the planet more than 150,000 times over the course of 28 years and 10 months while transmitting over 2.5 million images of land surface conditions around the world, officially setting a new Guinness World Records title for “Longest-operating Earth observation satellite.”   The NASA/@USGS Landsat program provides the longest continuous space-based record of Earth’s land in existence, providing information essential for making informed decisions about Earth’s resources and environment.

Vivid green land frames the top and right sides of the image. The rest of the image is taken up by water. Most of the water has whitish sediments swirling through it. Starting from the middle top, the sediment turns rivers white. Moving down the image, the sediments start to settle out and deposit on the seafloor, turning the sea water a light blue with white streaks. Continuing downward, less and less sediment is present, and the water turns a deeper blue.

"Pluto’s largest moon has a history 👀⁣ ⁣ A little over nine years ago, on July 14, 2015, our New Horizons spacecraft captured high-resolution images of Charon, one of Pluto’s five moons. Charon is 754 miles (1,214 kilometers) across, half the size of Pluto, and the largest known satellite relative to its parent body. It orbits Pluto every 6.4 Earth days.⁣ ⁣ Pictures of Charon show a surprisingly complex and violent history. Many New Horizons scientists expected Charon to be a monotonous, crater-battered world; instead, they found a landscape covered with mountains, canyons, landslides, surface-color variations and more. ⁣ ⁣ A great canyon system stretches more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) across the entire face of Charon. Four times as long as the Grand Canyon, and twice as deep in places, these faults and canyons indicate a titanic geological upheaval in Charon’s past. Most striking is the reddish north (top) polar region, informally named Mordor Macula.⁣ ⁣ This image combines blue, red and infrared images taken by the spacecraft’s Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC); the colors are processed to best highlight the variation of surface properties across Charon.⁣ ⁣ Image description: A high resolution image of the moon Charon with a rugged surface pitted by large craters.

"Heckin’ Good Puppis  This roiling cauldron of gas and dust clouds sprinkled with bright blue hot young stars is NGC 2467. It was discovered in the nineteenth century and lies in the southern constellation of Puppis – not to be confused with the word “puppies,” even though they sound pretty similar – and is thought to be located about 13,000 light-years from Earth.  This star-forming region is a vast cloud of gas – mostly hydrogen – that serves as an incubator for new stars. Some of these youthful stars are peeking out from the dense clouds where they were born, but many others remain hidden. Those stars emit fierce ultraviolet radiation that causes the whole scene to glow while also sculpting the environment and gradually eroding the gas clouds. Studies have shown that most of the radiation comes from the single hot and brilliant massive star just above the center of this near-infrared image captured by @NASAHubble.  Image description: Bright blue stars are scattered across a dense field of orange and yellow clouds of gas and dust. Some of the stars shine very brightly and have four diffraction spikes, while others are a bit dimmer. Very little of the darkness of space can be seen through the clouds.

"Some people want all the attention 🙄  While capturing an image of galaxy NGC 7250, our @nasahubble telescope also saw a moment of stellar upstaging – a single star stealing the show.  Both the star and the galaxy are in the constellation Lacerta (The Lizard), but the star is a million times closer to us than the galaxy, which lies more than 45 million light-years away. This relative closeness is the only way a star can outshine an entire galaxy containing billions of stars.  This star is what astronomers call a “foreground star,” and it’s a bit of a nuisance. Its light can contaminate fainter light from more distant objects that astronomers want to study.  Then again, foreground stars aren’t all bad. In a technique called microlensing, the gravitational pull of a foreground star can be used to amplify the light of a background star that momentarily aligned with it. The exact timing and amount of light amplification can reveal clues to the nature of the foreground star and its accompanying planets.  Image description: Amid a backdrop of galaxies, a star shines brightly with a white-yellow light, slightly left of center.

"The early bird gets the worm this July!   All month in July, the planetary action is in the morning sky: From July 14-16, grab your binoculars and wake up early to catch Mars in the early morning before the sky starts to brighten, and you'll find the distant planet Uranus quite close by.  On July 30, look for a close gathering of Jupiter, Mars, and the Moon with the bright stars of the constellation Taurus in the a.m. sky before dawn.   For night owls, there are two easy-to-spot star clusters – M7, aka Ptolemy's Cluster, and M6, the Butterfly Cluster – are both located about 5 degrees east of the the bright stars that mark the ""stinger"" end of the scorpion's tail.

"Resembling the fury of a raging sea, this image from our @NASAHubble telescope actually shows a bubbly ocean of glowing hydrogen gas.  The Omega Nebula, found about 5,500 light-years from Earth, is a hotbed of star formation, where wave-like patterns of gas have been sculpted and illuminated by a torrent of ultraviolet radiation coming from new stars lurking just outside this picture (above and to the left).   The ultraviolet radiation is carving and heating the surfaces of cold hydrogen gas clouds. The warmed surfaces glow orange and red in this photograph. The intense heat and pressure cause some material to stream away from those surfaces, creating the glowing veil of even hotter greenish gas that masks background structures. The pressure on the tips of the waves may trigger new stars forming within them.  This image was released in 2003 to commemorate the thirteenth anniversary of Hubble's launch on April 24, 1990. Hubble continues to study the cosmos, helping astronomers and scientists make sense of our universe.  Image description: A colorful, hazy nebula.

"The stars, they aligned 🎶   See how those bright red, clumpy streaks in the top left are all slanted in the same direction to the same degree? They show aligned protostellar outflows, or jets of gas from newborn stars. @NASAWebb captures this phenomenon for the first time.   “Astronomers have long assumed that as clouds collapse to form stars, the stars will tend to spin in the same direction,” said principal investigator Klaus Pontoppidan of @NASAJPL. “However, this has not been seen so directly before. These aligned, elongated structures are a historical record of the fundamental way that stars are born.”   Previously, the objects appeared as blobs or were invisible in optical wavelengths. Webb’s sensitive infrared vision was able to pierce through the thick dust, resolving the stars and their outflows.   This area is part of the Serpens Nebula. Located 1,300 light-years from Earth, it’s only 1-2 million years old — very young in cosmic terms! It’s home to a dense cluster of newly forming stars (about 100,000 years old), seen at the center of this image.   Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Klaus Pontoppidan (NASA-JPL), Joel Green (STScI)   Image description: A young star-forming region is filled with wispy orange, red, and blue layers of gas and dust.

"Vivid auroras in Jupiter’s atmosphere  Eight years ago today, our @NASAHubble Space Telescope observed stunning light shows in the atmosphere of the largest planet in our solar system. Astronomers used Hubble’s ultraviolet capabilities to take this image on June 30, 2016. Auroras are created when high-energy particles enter a planet’s atmosphere near its magnetic poles and collide with atoms of gas.  At the time this image was captured, our Juno spacecraft was in the solar wind near Jupiter, on its way to entering Jupiter’s orbit on July 4, 2016. While Hubble observed and measured the auroras on Jupiter, Juno measured the properties of the solar wind itself: a perfect collaboration between a telescope and a space probe.

"Space potato 🥔  Phobos is the larger of Mars' two moons—but it's still only about 17 x 14 x 11 miles (27 by 22 by 18 kilometers) in diameter. Because Phobos is so small, its gravity isn't strong enough to pull it into a sphere (like Earth's Moon), giving it its lumpy shape.  Phobos is also on a collision course with Mars—though it'll take a while to get there. It's nearing the Red Planet at a rate of six feet (1.8 meters) every hundred years. At that rate, the moon will either crash into Mars in 50 million years or break up into a ring.   This image was taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on our Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been studying Mars since 2006.

"Go with the floe 🧊  These swirling ice floes are spinning off the shore of Greenland, as seen in this photo taken from space on June 4, 2024. Sea ice from the Arctic drifts down the Fram Strait, a 450-kilometer (280-mile)-wide passage that connects the Arctic Ocean with the Greenland Sea. Along the way, it breaks into smaller pieces and starts to melt in warmer ocean waters, creating the smoke-like swirls seen here.  In recent years, more of the Arctic Ocean's sea ice has become too young and thin to make the journey south. The movement of sea ice and freshwater out of the Arctic is part of the ocean circulation patterns that distribute heat around the planet, contributing to climate conditions worldwide — so scientists are keeping a close eye on how these floes flow.  Follow @NASAEarth for more updates from across our home planet.  Image description: An icy shore and dark blue ocean, as seen from space.

"NASA astronaut Matthew Dominick captured this photo of Hurricane Beryl in the Caribbean on July 1, 2024, while aboard the @ISS. NASA studies hurricanes from space through photos like this one, as well as observations from satellites. Hurricane first responders use this data, as well as scientists who want to understand how climate change impacts hurricanes.  Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones are all the same type of storm – tropical cyclones – and they all form the same way. When warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from near the surface, an area of lower air pressure is created. Air from surrounding areas with higher air pressure pushes into the low-pressure area. That “new” air becomes warm and moist and rises, too. As the air rises, though, it cools off and creates clouds. The whole system of clouds and wind spins and grows, fed by the ocean’s heat and water evaporating from the surface.  The distinctive “eye” of the storm is made by the system turning faster and faster. Tropical cyclones are categorized from 1-5 based on wind speed. For example, a Category 1 hurricane has winds of 74-95 mph (119-153 kph). A Category 4 hurricane, like Hurricane Beryl was at the time this image was captured, has winds of 130-156 mph (209-251 kph).

"All that you change changes you.  In a patch of the autumn sky that contains the constellations Perseus, Andromeda, and Triangulum, a beautiful interaction is happening. A larger spiral galaxy (UGC 1810) is pulled on by its smaller companion galaxy, distorting it into a rose-like shape.  The uncommon spiral patterns in the larger galaxy are a telltale sign of interaction. The large, outer arm appears partially as a ring, a feature seen when interacting galaxies actually pass through one another. This suggests that the smaller companion dived deep, but off-center, through UGC 1810.  UGC 1810 isn’t the only one changed, though. The smaller, S-shaped galaxy shows distinct signs of intense star formation at its nucleus, possibly triggered by the encounter with the larger galaxy.

"Some give their children the world, others give them space. ⭐ Our Galileo spacecraft was named for a father of modern astronomy, Galileo Galilei. Galileo was the first mission to measure Jupiter’s atmosphere directly with a descent probe, and the first to conduct long-term observations of the jovian system from orbit. Galileo orbited Jupiter for almost eight years and made close passes by all its major moons. It found evidence of subsurface liquid layers of saltwater on Europa, Ganymede and Callisto and it examined a diversity of volcanic activity on Io. Its camera and nine other instruments sent back reports that allowed scientists to determine, among other things, that Jupiter’s icy moon Europa probably has a subsurface ocean with more water than the total amount found on Earth. They discovered that the volcanoes of the moon Io repeatedly and rapidly resurface the little world. They found that the giant moon Ganymede possesses its own magnetic field. Galileo even carried a small probe that it deployed and sent deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, taking readings for almost an hour before the probe was crushed by overwhelming pressure. Image description: A portion of Jupiter’s moon Ganymede is pictured in black-and-white.

"Can I ask you… your name? 🎀  Seen by @NASAHubble, this delicate red ribbon crossing the cosmos is a remnant of a supernova that was viewed by humans 1,000 years ago from 7,000 light-years away. The name of this stellar explosion is SN 1006, and was observed in 1006 A.D. It would have been the brightest star ever seen by humans—so bright that it could be seen during the daytime.  A supernova is the explosive death of a white dwarf, the last stage of life of a Sun-like star. This twisted filament corresponds with where the blast is sweeping through surrounding gas. The diameter of this supernova is nearly 60 light-years, and is still expanding at a speed of about 6 million miles per hour (about 9.6 million kilometers per hour).

"Across the universe  Euclid, a @europeanspaceagency telescope with NASA contributions, uncovered hidden regions of star formation in Messier 78 (the bright region in the center) for the first time and mapped gas and dust in exceptional detail. Using its infrared camera, the telescope looked through clouds that usually hide the smaller objects in this star nursery. This image and four others recently released showcase Euclid’s ability to explore two large-scale cosmic mysteries: dark matter and dark energy.  While scientists have measured that dark matter makes up about 27% of the cosmos, they’re not sure what it is. Scientists think dark matter exists in a vast, web-like structure that winds through the whole universe – a gravitational scaffold that attracts most of the cosmos’ normal matter. They’ve determined that dark matter isn’t composed of known particles of matter because the universe would look quite different if it were.  Observations of the universe have shown that the universe is expanding, and that it’s expanding faster now than it did in the past. We don’t know why, but the leading explanation is that the universe contains something that has a repulsive gravitational effect – it pushes the universe apart instead of pulling it back together. This phenomenon is called dark energy.  By 2030, Euclid will create a cosmic map that covers almost a third of the sky. Scientists will then chart the presence of dark matter with higher precision than ever before. They also could use this map to study how dark energy’s strength has changed over time.

"You know Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, Saturn, and Geminid meteors, too, But do you recall... the longest night of them all? (In the Northern Hemisphere, that is.)  This month has it all: planetary cameos, appearances from distant stars, and the winter triangle. Tune in to hear what’s up for December.   Planet Visibility Mercury: Visible very low in the southeast just before sunrise during the last half of the month. Venus: Shines brightly as the ""Evening Star"" in the southwest after sunset, climbing higher each evening. Mars: Brightens significantly during December, rising in the east-northeast and visible from late evening to early morning. Jupiter: Reaches opposition on Dec. 7, making it visible all night, rising in the east-northeast. Saturn: Visible after sunset in the southern sky, shifting slightly westward as the month progresses.   Highlights Dec. 3-5 – Venus and the Moon: Look southwest after sunset to see a beautiful pairing. On Dec. 4, a slim crescent Moon will sit directly below Venus. Dec. 7 – Jupiter at Opposition: Jupiter will shine at its brightest for the year, rising in the east-northeast among Taurus's stars. Best viewed through a telescope for details like the Galilean moons and atmospheric belts. Dec. 14 – Jupiter, the Moon, and Aldebaran: Look for Jupiter midway between the nearly full Moon and bright orange star Aldebaran in the evening sky. Dec. 17 – Mars and the Moon: Mars, glowing brightly in its approach to opposition, appears super close to the waning gibbous Moon. All Month – Winter Triangle: Formed by Sirius, Procyon, and Betelgeuse, this asterism marks the arrival of winter skies and is a prominent feature throughout the season. Dec. 13-14 – Geminid Meteor Shower: The peak occurs under a nearly full Moon, reducing visibility, but bright meteors may still be spotted the week before. Dec. 21 – Winter Solstice: At 4:20 a.m. EST, the solstice marks the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere.

"Chilling out in Brazil 🌊  Located to the east of Rio de Janeiro, Cabo Frio is Portuguese for ""Cape Cold"" — so named because the ocean that surrounds it is unusually chilly. Strong northeasterly winds that blow along Cabo Frio's coast push warm surface waters away from the shore, allowing cool water from deeper in the ocean to rise to the surface. This upwelled water is also rich in nutrients, helping feed the rich marine ecosystem off of Cabo Frio's shores.  This image of Cabo Frio was taken from space on September 16, 2023, by the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) instrument aboard Landsat 9, a partnership between NASA and @USGS.

"Stand out above the crowd ✨⁣ ⁣ This is NGC 2005. It’s a glittery star cluster – a globular cluster – and it’s kinda weird. NGC 2005’s stars have a chemical composition that is distinct from the stars around it in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the Milky Way’s largest satellite galaxy.⁣ ⁣ This suggests that the LMC underwent a merger with another galaxy somewhere in its history. That other galaxy has long-since merged and otherwise scattered, but NGC 2005 remains as an ancient witness to the merger.⁣ ⁣ Globular clusters are large and dense, containing several thousand to millions of stars all formed from a shared nebula. These clusters are stable and contain some of the oldest known stars in a galaxy, so they’re an excellent laboratory to study galaxy evolution.⁣ ⁣ Image description: A globular cluster that looks like a very dense, ball-shaped collection of many shining stars in colors of white, yellow-orange, and blue. Some stars appear a bit larger and brighter than others, with the brightest having faint cross-shaped diffraction spikes.

"That’s not a giant bath bomb, it’s our Moon!  We usually see Earth’s Moon in shades of gray, but here in this composite photo made from images captured by our Galileo spacecraft, it’s a riot of reds, oranges, and blues. And sure, it’s pretty, but that’s not the (only) reason we color images.  The unusual colors in this photograph help scientists study what the Moon’s soil is made of. Areas appearing red generally correspond to the lunar highlands, while blue to orange shades indicate the ancient volcanic lava flow of a mare, or lunar sea. Bluer mare areas contain more titanium than the orange regions do. The deep blue patch on the right is Mare Tranquillitatis, and it’s richer in titanium than Mare Serenitatis, a slightly smaller circular area to the upper left of Mare Tranquillitatis. Finally, the small purple areas found near the center are deposits formed by explosive volcanic eruptions.  The solid-state imaging system on Galileo captured 15 images of the Moon through three color filters while the spacecraft passed through the Earth-Moon system on Dec. 8, 1992. When this view was obtained, the spacecraft was 262,000 miles (425,000 kilometers) from the Moon and 43,000 miles (69,000 kilometers) from Earth. Galileo continued on to its main mission: studying Jupiter. It orbited the planet for almost eight years, made close passes by all of the planet's major moons, and ended its mission by intentionally crashing into Jupiter on Sept. 21, 2003.  While this image won’t give you a luxurious bubble bath, meditating on all its colors can be just as relaxing.  Image description: The Moon is awash in shades of red, blue, and orange.

"Cause we are sisters, we stand together ⭐   Surrounded by sweeping clouds of dust are the Seven Sisters. Also known as the Pleiades, this star cluster is 445 light-years away in the constellation Taurus. There are clearly way more than seven stars in this image – this star cluster actually contains over a thousand stars loosely bound by gravity. However, a handful of these stars are brighter than their siblings, standing out visually.   This image was captured by the infrared camera on our now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope. The colors in the picture correspond to infrared wavelengths: light with a wavelength of 4.5 microns is blue; light of 8 microns is green; and light of 24 microns is red.   The Sisters are also visible from the ground. For best viewing, find them with a pair of binoculars in November through March. You’ll find them toward the south in the Northern Hemisphere and toward the north in the Southern Hemisphere.

"It's a classic for a reason  ⁣ @NASAHubble took this detailed image of a classic spiral galaxy, which is located 100 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Leo Minor. The galactic spiral holds a bright core, from which a pinwheel array of arms appears to radiate outward. Dark dust lanes and bright star-forming regions help define these spiral arms.⁣  ⁣ The galaxy's distinct shape may be one reason why astronomer Edwin Hubble, for whom the Hubble Space Telescope was named, used it to help define his classification of galaxies. Hubble authored a paper in 1926 that outlined the classification of some four hundred galaxies by their appearance — as either spiral, barred spiral, lenticular, elliptical, or irregular.  Our Milky Way also belongs to the broad class of galaxies defined by the presence of spiral arms.

"A nursery of stars, caught in NASA's Webb 🕸️  Officially known as 30 Doradus, this star-forming region is nicknamed the Tarantula Nebula for its long, intricate filaments of dust. It's the largest and brightest such region near our Milky Way galaxy—and it's home to some of the hottest, most massive stars we've ever observed.  This image of the Tarantula Nebula was captured by the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) aboard @NASAWebb. Webb's infrared instruments aren't just giving us a high-definition look into the universe—they're able to peer into clouds of gas and dust that are blocked to visual telescopes and our own eyes.  Image description: A space image captured by the Webb telescope. Fluffy tan-colored nebula clouds, with rust-colored highlights, surround a black central area. Within that area, the focal point of the image is one large yellow star with eight long thin points. To the right of this star is a bright star cluster in an oval shape. The stars within the cluster look like tiny pale blue sparkles. The cluster is more densely packed at its core and scatters outward. Towards the bottom of the image, multiple arms appear to spiral out of a cloudy tan knob, resembling a spider or a squid structure. Other blue and yellow eight-pointed stars, as well as distant galaxies, are dotted throughout the image.

"These are the voyages of the space shuttle Enterprise 🚀  On June 4, 1974—50 years ago today—construction began on NASA's first space shuttle. Officially designated OV-101, Enterprise received its more common name after a dedicated write-in campaign by fans of the original Star Trek TV series. When Enterprise made its public debut in California on Sept. 17, 1976, several cast members from the show, as well as creator Gene Roddenberry, were on hand to attend.  Enterprise made its first independent flight on Aug. 12, 1977, released from atop a Boeing 747 to test the shuttle's approach and landing capabilities. Built to perform test flights in the atmosphere, Enterprise never reached orbit but paved the way for NASA's next generation of spacecraft.

During the 18th century, French astronomer Charles Messier compiled a list of over 100 cosmic objects that might fool fellow comet hunters into thinking they had discovered new comets – the Messier catalog. In the 1980s, an Englishman named Sir Patrick Moore produced an additional list to highlight more cosmic wonders visible to amateur astronomers. His second surname was Caldwell, so he used that instead of Moore, since “M” was already taken by Messier. This nebula is the 20th item in the Caldwell catalog, which consists of 46 star clusters, 35 galaxies, and 28 nebulas.   If you’d like to see Caldwell 20, you should look for it in fall in the Northern Hemisphere and in spring in the Southern Hemisphere. Caldwell 20 is in the constellation Cygnus, appearing more than three times larger than the full moon. It’s not very bright, but binoculars will show it glowing subtly against its galactic backdrop.

"A star is born ✨⁣  ⁣ HP Tau, 550 light-years from Earth, is the youngest star in a three-star system. (It’s the one at the top of the triangle.) HP Tau is in the process of turning into a star like our Sun, but it’s likely less than 10 million years old—for comparison, the Sun is around 4.6 billion years old.⁣  ⁣ Scientists are using our orbiting @NASAHubble telescope to study HP Tau and learn more about protoplanetary disks, the disks of material around stars that form into planets over millions of years. HP Tau is also a variable star, which means that it gets brighter and dimmer over time. These variations could be due to the star’s turbulent childhood, with gas and dust around the star both blocking its light and feeding its growth. More predictable changes in brightness could be caused by giant sunspots rotating in and out of view.⁣  ⁣ Image description: A hazy blue nebula surrounds a cluster of bright stars.

"Two views of a cosmic classic @NASAHubble captured this iconic view of the Pillars of Creation, showing off towers that stretch light-years in length, around 7,000 light-years away from Earth in the direction of the constellation Serpens. The Pillars of Creation are part of an active star-forming region within the Eagle Nebula, hiding newborn stars in the columns of dust and gas. In this image captured in visible light, blue represents oxygen, red sulfur, and green is both nitrogen and hydrogen. @NASAWebb also captured the Pillars of Creation in near-infrared-light, helping researchers revamp their ideas on how new stars form in nebulae. By viewing the cosmic phenomena in different wavelengths, scientists can get a more precise count of stars hidden within and beneath the pillars. Image descriptions: Two images are shown of the Pillars of Creation, a star-forming region in space. The first one is Hubble’s visible-light view, which shows darker pillars that rise from the bottom to the top of the screen, ending in three points.

"This is what it looks like when the Sun lights up the night sky. Earlier this month, the Sun created the largest solar storm to reach Earth in two decades, with possibly the most brilliant and widespread display of auroras in the past 500 years. The storm’s coronal mass ejections soared through space at speeds up to 3 million mph (4.8 million kph), bunching up in waves that reached Earth on May 10 and creating a G5 geomagnetic storm — a level last seen on Earth in 2003. As the storm reached Earth, it created a beautiful aurora that illuminated the sky and was seen around the globe, even visible in areas including the southern U.S. and northern India. Monitoring data on space weather help us understand the impacts on satellites, crewed missions, Earth, and space-based infrastructure. Submitting your aurora photos and reports to the NASA-funded Aurorasaurus.org site can help scientists study the event as we work to understand and prepare for these events. Image description: An image of a coronal aurora taken from the point of view of somebody standing on the ground and looking directly upward at the sky.

"You make a loop-de-loop and pull, and your Sun is looking cool! 🌞 Late at night on May 7 and in the wee hours of May 8, the Sun emitted this powerful pair of solar flares. These two energetic flashes with dancing loops were captured by @NASAGoddard’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, which always has its eye on the Sun. The Sun—like even the most vibrant people—is not a constant ray of sunshine. It constantly cycles through periods of higher and lower activity. High activity can lead to these solar flares, or dramatic explosions of energy out from the Sun. The strongest flares are known as “X-class flares,” like the two shown here. The number of solar flares increases every 11 years or so around what is called a solar maximum. Scientists expect the Sun’s activity to ramp up as we approach solar maximum; there have been 13 X-class solar flares so far this year. When directed at Earth, the most powerful flares could disrupt satellites, GPS signals, and radio communications. Because of that, a multitude of space and land-based instruments keep watch for potential impacts.  Video descriptions: A swipethrough of the two X-class solar flares.

"Happy 34th launchiversary to @NASAHubble! 🛰️ Since it first headed into orbit on April 24, 1990, #Hubble has made 1.6 million observations of 53,000 astronomical objects and helped generate 44,000 scientific papers. Hubble has helped humanity look toward the origins of our universe, witness the birth and death of stars, and study cosmic phenomena. In celebration of its launch, astronomers captured this image of the Little Dumbbell Nebula, which lies 3,400 light-years away in the constellation Perseus. The Little Dumbbell comprises an expanding shell of flowing gases ejected from a dying red giant star that will soon collapse and form a white dwarf star. Image description: A rectangle of space with a black background scattered with gold-colored stars, some with four-point spikes.

"It's your day, Planet Earth.  We've been celebrating #EarthDay for more than 50 years—and in 2024, we're shining the spotlight on our home world's oceans. The ocean holds about 97% of Earth's water and covers 70% of our planet's surface; it's home to 50%-80% of life on Earth. NASA currently operates 26 missions in orbit that observe Earth's oceans, land, ice, and atmosphere. We're studying how they change over time, working with institutions around the world to protect our planet.  This classic ""blue marble"" photo of the Earth was taken on Dec. 7, 1972, by the crew of Apollo 17: astronauts Eugene A. Cernan, Ronald E. Evans, and Harrison H. Schmitt captured the Earth's Southern Hemisphere on their journey to the Moon. Four days later, Cernan and Schmitt touched down on the Moon, becoming the final Apollo astronauts to walk on the lunar surface. Our #Artemis missions will return to the Moon, establishing a long-term presence to help us prepare for the exploration of Mars—while taking care of spaceship Earth.  We'd love to see you share your own corner of Earth, especially if it's near water! Take a #GlobalSelfie and post it to Instagram or your preferred social platform.

"Light echo? We Like the sound of that!⁣  ⁣ For reasons unknown, the surface of the star V838 Mon expanded so much, it became the brightest star in the Milky Way Galaxy in January 2002. Then, just as suddenly, it faded. A stellar flash like this had never been seen before. During its outburst, the star’s intrinsic brightness flared to roughly 600,000 times that of our Sun. The star may have swallowed a companion star or planet, triggering the burst. Although the V838 Mon flash appears to expel material into space, what is seen in the above image from the @NASAHubble Space Telescope is an outwardly moving light echo of the bright flash.⁣  ⁣ In a light echo, light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant rings in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star.

This is not just any planetary nebula; it’s a bipolar nebula. ⁣ ⁣ Unlike ordinary nebulas with one star at the center, this nebula has two stars at the center, making it a bipolar nebula. One star is a small white dwarf while the other is approaching the end of its days. The two stars circle one another roughly every 100 years. It is believed that the dying star has ejected its outer layers of gas into space and is being pulled into two lobes instead of a sphere. ⁣ ⁣ The rotation around one another causes the shape of the wings for this cosmic butterfly.

This data was collected on almost 500 stars over a three-year period — offering new insights into star formation, evolution and how their surroundings impact them.⁣  ⁣ Two categories of stars were studied in this survey: Super-hot massive stars and young less massive stars. The super-hot massive, blue stars are a million times brighter than the Sun and have a fierce glow in ultraviolet light which can be easily detected by Hubble. These stars have powerful winds that drive galaxy evolution. ULLYSES targeted these blue stars in nearby galaxies because they were common in the early universe.⁣  ⁣ The young stars less massive than our Sun, in their formative years, unleashed high energy radiation and blasts of ultraviolet light and X-rays. Since they are still growing, they continue to gather material from their surroundings. The survey includes the process of how they attain their mass and how much energy is released to the nearby environment. These observations are just a stepping stone to understanding the first stars of the universe and how they impacted the evolution of the galaxy.⁣  ⁣ Image description: A cluster of glowing blue stars closer to the right side in the center of the image.

Thanks to telescopes like @NASAHubble, we can study nebulas like this one and gather clues about how stars are made.  Nebulas are made of dust and gases, which can get pulled together into clumps by gravity. Eventually, a clump will get so big that it collapses from gravity, heating the material at its center. That hot core is the beginning of a star. Star birth is a violent process, producing intense ultraviolet radiation that carves out cavities in clouds and erodes material from giant gas pillars, but it’s also what creates this dramatic, beautiful scene.  In addition to baby stars, the Carina Nebula also contains many giant stars that are at least 50 to 100 times the mass of our Sun! One such star is Eta Carinae.

"The 2024 total solar #eclipse is happening on April 8—the last total solar eclipse crossing the U.S. for the next 20 years. Here’s what makes it even more exciting than the one in 2017. - The path of totality will be a wider, more populated path than the 2017 “Great American Eclipse.” An estimated 31.6 million people live in the path of totality this year. - This eclipse will have a longer time in totality than 2017, lasting up to 4 minutes and 28 seconds. - This year the Sun will be at or near a solar maximum, causing heightened solar activity. So grab your eclipse glasses and get ready to be starstruck! Host a watch party or watch with us on plus.nasa.gov. Transcript:What makes the April 8th eclipse such a big deal? Here’s why you don’t want to miss out.[More time in totality]An eclipse crossed the US in 2017, but totality only lasted up to 2 minutes 42 seconds. This time, the Moon will completely block the Sun for over 4 minutes in some areas.[The Sun is more active]2017 was a calm period for our Sun. But in 2024, it’s much more active. That means there’s a much better chance of seeing giant streamers, prominences, or even a solar eruption.[A wider path is more populated]This time, the Moon’s shadow will be wider and will pass over more populated areas. Nearly 3 times as many people live within the path compared to the eclipse in 2017. There won’t be another total eclipse crossing the US until 2045.So don’t miss out! Credit: NASA #Eclipse #NASA #SolarEclipse #Sun #Moon #Eclipse2024 #TotalSolarEclipse",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/C401dSkpAH8/,post_397.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MKDCUba9teh1n75-97I1ZA4lYnx9oFEz

"Happy St. Patrick's Day 💚⁣  ⁣ With a bit of luck, spectators near the North or South Pole can see auroras. In the Northern Hemisphere, these are called aurora borealis or the northern lights. If you're near the South Pole, they are called aurora australis or the southern lights. Auroras are caused by solar activity like solar flares (explosions on the Sun) or coronal mass ejections (ejected gas bubbles), which, carried by solar winds, interact with Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere.⁣  ⁣ The Sun's activity levels don't stay constant. They go through phases of high and low activity called the solar cycle. Scientists expect the Sun's activity to ramp up toward the next peak of solar activity, called the solar maximum, which is predicted for July 2025, so be sure to wear sunscreen and book a vacation to Earth's poles to see an aurora!⁣  ⁣ Image description: A green aurora is seen over Poker Flat Research Range near Fairbanks, Alaska.

"We’re never *over* the Moon. ⁣ But, we are pleased with the Moon sighting opportunities in March! ⁣ ⁣ This month, you’ll find Jupiter shining brightly in the west during the early evening hours all month long. And on March 13th, it’s joined by a crescent Moon so close that the pair will be visible together through binoculars.⁣ ⁣ On the following evening, the Moon visits the Pleiades, a star cluster visible to the unaided eye. This is another close pairing – with the five-day-old lunar crescent hanging right next to the bright star cluster – that will look great through a small telescope or binoculars.⁣ ⁣ Overnight on March 24th and into the 25th, the Moon will pass through the outer part of Earth’s shadow, creating a faint lunar eclipse called a penumbral eclipse. Now, the more spectacular variety of lunar eclipses happens when the Moon passes through Earth’s inner shadow, or umbra. That’s when we see a dark “bite” taken out of the Moon, or in the case of a total lunar eclipse, a reddish, so-called “blood moon.” Penumbral eclipses cause only a slight dimming of the Moon’s brightness, so if you’re not looking for it, you might not know there was an eclipse happening. But if you glance at the Moon early in the night, and then later, around the peak of the eclipse, you might notice the difference in brightness.⁣ ⁣ Image description: A crescent moon is visible in this view of Earth’s horizon and airglow, photographed by an Expedition 13 crewmember on the International Space Station.

"Near side of the Moon, sure. But have you seen the north side? On its way toward Jupiter in 1992, our Galileo spacecraft snapped photos of the Moon. They included this mosaic of the Moon’s North Pole; a combination of 18 different photos. From this view, the Moon’s nearside is illuminated on the lower left, and its farside is shadowed on the upper right. The dark craters along its lower ridge are those that we would normally see when looking up at the Moon from Earth. Ever wondered why the Moon’s craters are so dark? It’s because they are massive pools of hardened lava. Our Moon had a heavily volcanic past, but some patches suggest more recent volcanic activity. For instance, in 1971, Apollo 15 astronauts observed what looked like the aftermath of a lunar volcanic eruption. Image description: An image of the northern pole of the Moon, with the lower-left half illuminated and the other half shadowed.

"Shedding some light on spiral galaxies 🌀 At a distance of about 30 million light-years from Earth, the Whirlpool Galaxy is one of the brightest spirals in the night sky. This composite image of the Whirlpool Galaxy shows the majesty of its structure in a dramatic new way through several of NASA’s orbiting observatories. As you swipe through different spectra, each shows the galaxy through a new lens: X-ray data from @NASAChandraXray reveals point-like sources (purple) that are black holes and neutron stars in binary star systems. Chandra also detects a diffuse glow of hot gas that permeates the space between the stars. Optical data from the @NASAHubble (green) and infrared emission from the Spitzer Space Telescope (red*) both highlight long lanes in the spiral arms that consist of stars and gas laced with dust. A view of M51 with the GALEX telescope shows hot, young stars that produce lots of ultraviolet energy (blue). Image descriptions: 1. Composite image of the Whirlpool galaxy. The larger of the two galaxies is blue, with red details, highlighted with bright purple stars. The companion galaxy shines in green, also with red detail. 2. X-ray image of the Whirlpool galaxy.

"Things just got Messier.⁣  ⁣ A team of astronomers used @NASAWebb to survey the starburst galaxy, Messier 82 (M82). Located 12 million light-years away in constellation Ursa Major, the galaxy is relatively compact in size, but is home to a frenzy of star formation activity at a rate 10 times faster than our own Milky Way galaxy.⁣  ⁣ M82 has been observed by both NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope and @NASAHubble, but Webb’s infrared perspective allows us a closer look at the physical conditions that foster the formation of new stars.⁣  ⁣ Image descriptions:⁣ 1. A section of Messier 82 as imaged by the Webb Telescope. An edge-on spiral starburst galaxy with a bright white, glowing core, set against the black background of space. A white band of the edge-on disk extends from lower left to upper right. Dark brown tendrils of dust are heavily threaded through this band. Many white points in various sizes (stars or star clusters) are scattered across the image, but are most heavily concentrated toward the center. Just outside the bright core and the brown tendrils of dust, the surrounding mass of stars appears to glow faintly blueish-purple. Toward the center, tiny specks in green denote concentrations of iron, most of which are supernova remnants. Small red patches signify regions where molecular hydrogen is being lit up by a nearby star’s radiation.⁣  ⁣ 2. Webb image very similar to the previous one but taken at slightly longer near-infrared wavelength which shows the lighter brown tendrils of galactic wind caused by the rapid rate of star formation threaded through the galaxy’s center. Additionally, there are many clumpy, red filaments extending vertically above and below the galaxy’s plane.

"Pressure makes diamonds, but ram pressure can make stars! 🌟⁣  ⁣ A dwarf galaxy in constellation Coma Berenices, located 54 million light-years away, is undergoing a highly-energetic event, captured here by @NASAHubble. The little galaxy is undergoing a process called ram pressure stripping that is driving unusually high levels of star formation in regions of the galaxy.⁣  ⁣ The gas and dust that permeate space exert pressure on galaxies. This resistance, called ram pressure, can strip a galaxy of its star-forming gas and dust, or may limit the creation of new stars. However, ram pressure can also compress gas in other parts of the galaxy, which can boost star formation. In this case, the galaxy appears to have absolutely no star formation along its edges, which bear the brunt of ram pressure stripping, but the star formation rates deeper within the galaxy are booming!⁣  ⁣ Image description: A dwarf spiral galaxy. The center is not particularly bright and is covered by some dust, while the outer disk and halo wrap around as if swirling in water.

Astronaut Bruce McCandless II became the first astronaut to move in space unattached to a craft, during this first “field” tryout of a nitrogen-propelled, hand-controlled backpack device called the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU).⁣  ⁣ Robert L. “Hoot” Gibson, the flight’s pilot, was the only one on the crew that “had absolutely nothing to do” as McCandless made his way out into space, so he picked up a Hasselblad camera and began documenting the events. When he first looked through the camera’s viewfinder, he could not believe what an incredible sight it was to see McCandless floating free above the Earth. Gibson wanted to capture what he was seeing and remembered how meticulous he was. For each photograph he took three light meter readings and checked the focus four times. In the crew’s photography training he learned that an off-kilter horizon looked wrong and was not pleasing to the eye. That presented a slight problem because Challenger was at a 28.5-degree inclination, so he “tilted the camera to put the horizon level in the pictures.”⁣  ⁣ Image description: Astronaut McCandless II appears as a tiny figure clad in a white spacesuit surrounded by the blackness of space.

Earth takes about 365.2422 days to make one revolution around the Sun. That’s about six hours longer than the 365 days that we typically include in a calendar year. As a result, every four years we have about 24 extra hours that we add to the calendar at the end of February in the form of leap day.⁣  ⁣ Without leap day, the dates of annual events, such as equinoxes and solstices, would slowly shift to later in the year, changing the dates of each season. After only a century without leap day, summer wouldn’t start until mid-July!⁣  ⁣  ⁣ Image description: The western hemisphere of the Blue Marble, created in 2002.

"It’s the side of the Moon we never see from home: the far side.⁣ ⁣ Often incorrectly called the “dark side” of the Moon – incorrect because it receives equal amounts of sunlight as the near side does – the Moon’s far side has stark characteristics. To start, it’s more heavily cratered and has fewer maria, or large, dark, basaltic plains created by early volcanic eruptions. They’re called maria because that’s the Latin word for “seas.” Early astronomers thought the dark areas were oceans.⁣ ⁣ So why can’t we see it from Earth? The same side of the Moon always faces us because the Moon is tidally locked to our planet. That means the Moon’s orbital period is the same duration as its spin around its axis.

Originally planned to fly up to five times in 30 days as a technology demo, Ingenuity conducted 72 flights over its lifetime, traveling 11 miles (17 km) through the thin Martian atmosphere with over 120 minutes of total flight time.  Ingenuity teamed up with our Perseverance rover to study the Martian landscape and look for evidence of long-ago life—and, just as importantly, showed that it's possible for humanity to fly on other worlds.

"It’s Mercury on the dance floor, but you better not kill the groove! 🪩⁣  ⁣ Donned in colorful shades, data from the MESSENGER mission is modeled to shed light on how certain types of comets influence the tiny space rocks, or micrometeoroids, that impact our smallest planetary neighbor, Mercury.⁣  ⁣ According to experts at @NASAGoddard, simulations from variations in meteoroid impacts reveal surprising patterns in the time of day that impacts occur: mornings. Noting a higher presence of magnesium and calcium in the exosphere indicated that meteoroid impacts are more frequent on whatever part of the planet is experiencing dawn at the given time. Impact speed was then considered - meteoroids from asteroids wouldn’t be moving fast enough to create the observed impacts. Eventually, it was narrowed to meteoroids from two certain types of comets – Jupiter-family and Halley-Type – that had the speed necessary to match the observations.⁣  ⁣ Learn more about missions happening within our solar system at @NASASolarSystem.⁣  ⁣ Image description: A mosaic made up of four views of Mercury using data from the Mercury Atmosphere and Surface Composition Spectrometer or MASCS, instrument is overlaid on data from the Mercury Dual Imaging System, or MDIS.

"This year’s NYE fireworks are brought to you by the cosmos!⁣ ⁣ This stellar show captured by @NASAChandraXRay is a nova called GK Persei. It’s an example of a “classical nova,” or an outburst of mass caused by a thermonuclear explosion on the dense surface of a white dwarf star. This often happens when a white dwarf and a larger star – often a red giant – orbit each other. Together, they become a binary star system. The white dwarf rips material from its companion star, and if enough borrowed mass accumulates on the surface of the white dwarf, a cosmic blast occurs, resulting in a stellar fireworks display.⁣ ⁣ Classical novae can be considered ""mini supernovae."" The fundamental physics between them are the same, but classical novae are smaller, less energetic, and don’t result in the star’s destruction.⁣ ⁣ Image Description: A firework-like explosion stands out against black space.

"Seen here by @NASAWebb, ice giant Uranus is a dynamic world with rings, moons, storms, extreme seasons, and more. Webb’s sensitivity has even captured the close-in Zeta ring: faint, diffuse, and elusive.  These new images reveal detailed features of Uranus’s seasonal north polar cap, as well as bright storms near and below the southern border of the cap. If humans want to send a spacecraft to visit Uranus up close, it’s necessary to understand how to navigate debris from its rings.  Because of the planet’s extreme 98 degree tilt, its seasons are extreme. For a quarter of its year, the Sun shines on one pole, which means half the planet experiences a dark, 21-Earth year winter.  Context is king! Uranus is a good proxy for many of the types of far-off exoplanets being discovered. Learning more about Uranus may help us understand more about planets of this size in general, including their meteorology, and how they formed. Read more at the link in @NASAWebb’s bio.  Image description: Slide 1 shows an image with a black background. The planet Uranus is a glowing orb near the center surrounded by rings. The planet appears blue with a large, white patch taking up the right half. The patch is whitest at the center, then fades into blue at it expands from right to left. A thin outline of Uranus is also white. Around the planet is a system of nested rings. There are faint orange and off-white smudges, some oval, some circular, that are background galaxies scattered throughout the image. Several bright blue point sources closer to Uranus are the planet’s moons. There is also a bright star at the left of the field, with 8 diffraction spikes. Slide 2 is the same view, but zoomed in. The outermost ring is the brightest while the innermost ring is the faintest.

"Let’s make the most of this beautiful day. Won’t you be my neighbor?⁣ ⁣ It’s a beautiful day in this galactic neighborhood captured by @NASAHubble, but things aren’t as close as they appear. The four large spiral galaxies featured in this snapshot seem near each other, but they are quite distant. This image is a great example of the challenge of determining the separation between galaxies from a 2-dimensional point of view.⁣ ⁣ For instance, the largest galaxy to the right, NGC 1356, appears to be directly adjacent to the small galaxy overlapping one of its arms, LEDA 95415. In reality, they are nearly 300 million light-years apart. Meanwhile, the galaxy to the left, IC 1947, is only around 400,000 away from NGC 1356 despite seeming further off in 2-D.⁣ ⁣ Image description: A collection of four galaxies stands out against black space littered with stars and other tiny galaxies.

"The Green Monster would have gotten away with it too, if it weren’t for these two meddling space telescopes 🔎⁣ ⁣ In April 2023, @NASAWebb infrared data detected an unusual structure. It was dubbed the “Green Monster” because of its resemblance to the wall in the left field of Fenway Park. However, by combining the Webb data with X-rays from @NASAChandraXray, researchers think they have hunted down the source of the Green Monster.⁣ ⁣ When a massive star exploded to create Cassiopeia A (aka Cas A) about 340 years ago, from Earth’s perspective, it created a ball of matter and light that expanded outward. The debris from the star is seen by Chandra because it is heated to tens of millions of degrees by shock waves, akin to sonic booms from a supersonic plane. Webb can see some material that has not been affected by shock waves, what can be called “pristine” debris. Much of this lies behind the Green Monster. The combination of Webb and Chandra data therefore gives a better idea of the total debris from the exploded star.⁣ ⁣ Image description: This image of Cassiopeia A resembles a disk of electric light with red clouds, glowing white streaks, red and orange flames, and an area near the center of the remnant resembling a somewhat circular region of green lightning. X-rays from Chandra are blue and reveal hot gas, mostly from supernova debris from the destroyed star, and include elements like silicon and iron. X-rays are also present as thin arcs in the outer regions of the remnant.⁣ ⁣ Infrared data from Webb is red, green, and blue. Webb highlights infrared emission from dust that is warmed up because it is embedded in the hot gas seen by Chandra, and from much cooler supernova debris. Hubble data shows a multitude of stars that permeate the field of view.⁣ ⁣ Credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/SAO; Optical: NASA/ESA/STScI; IR: NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI/Milisavljevic et al., NASA/JPL/CalTech; Image Processing: NASA/CXC/SAO/J.

"The future of supersonic flight is here.⁣ ⁣ Our X-59 aircraft, which will reduce sonic booms to quieter sonic “thumps,” has been unveiled. The X-59 now moves closer to its first flight and one step closer toward potentially making commercial supersonic flight over land a reality.⁣ ⁣ How it works: The aircraft’s sleek design means shock waves don’t merge to make a loud, disruptive sound. Instead, the waves stay separated and rapidly weaken. While the plane is not a prototype for future aircraft, manufacturers could apply its quiet supersonic technologies. After Lockheed Martin pilots conduct initial subsonic flight tests in 2024, NASA pilots will conduct supersonic flight tests over yet-to-be-selected communities across the United States. Surveys from these flyovers could inform regulators on how to reopen the skies to commercial supersonic flight.⁣ Visit nasa.gov/quesst for updates. ⁣ The X-59 was designed and built by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company at its Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California.

"The year 2023 was the hottest year in NASA’s record, continuing a trend of warming global temperatures.Our record is calculated from millions of measurements from thousands of weather stations, ships and ocean buoys, and Antarctic research stations. It uses data starting in 1880, when coverage made it possible to reliably estimate global temperature.Despite 2023 being the globally hottest year, individual locations may not have experienced a record-warm year. However, the effects of our changing climate are felt around the globe, with record droughts, shifting fire seasons, and sudden, intense precipitation events.With more than 20 spacecraft and thousands of researchers studying Earth systems and the impacts of rising global temperatures, we’re helping people prepare for life on Earth now and in the future.

"To: All explorers, new and seasonedFrom: The Universe 🎁This beautiful image from the @NASAWebb Telescope is a gift from a past star. In near-infrared light, supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A) resembles a shiny ornament that decks the halls of homes during the holiday season.With its powerful vision, the Webb Telescope can detect the tiniest knots of sulfur, oxygen, argon and neon gas from the star. Embedded in the gas are dust and molecules that will eventually become part of new stars and planets.See that blob in the bottom right? Scientists have nicknamed it Baby Cas A since it looks like a tiny version of Cas A itself. Baby Cas A is a light echo: Light from the supernova has reached and is warming the distant dust in this blob. Although Baby Cas A appears very close to Cas A, it’s actually about 170 light-years behind the supernova remnant.It is our hope that this breathtaking image and stunning science inspires a bit of magic, wonder, and joy for anyone who takes a moment to look up at our shared starry-night sky.Image Description: Cassiopeia A, a round cloud of gas and dust with complex structure. The inner shell is made of bright pink and orange filaments studded with clumps and knots. Around the exterior of the inner shell, particularly at the upper right, there are curtains of wispy gas that look like campfire smoke. The white smoke-like material also appears to fill the cavity of the inner shell, featuring structures shaped like large bubbles. Around and within the nebula, there are various stars seen as points of blue and white light.

"Enceladus has water, but we have the tea 🪐⁣  ⁣ A study using data from our @NASASolarSystem Cassini indicates there may be much more chemical energy inside Saturn’s tiny moon than previously thought – along with evidence of a key ingredient for life.⁣ ⁣ We’ve known Enceladus is spewing ice grains and water rich with organic compounds from a giant plume – some of which are important to life. New analysis has found a strong confirmation of hydrogen cyanide, a molecule key to the origin of life. ⁣ ⁣ That’s not all – researchers have found evidence of an ocean hiding below the moon’s icy outer shell, this also supports the giant plume with a supercharged source of energy. Unidentified in this study, the source is in the form of several organic compounds, some of which on Earth serve as fuel for organisms. ⁣ ⁣ More chemical energy is brewing inside Saturn’s tiny moon than previously thought.

At the near-infrared wavelengths to which Hubble is sensitive, the central region appears dark because there is so much obscuring dust in the way. However near-infrared light leaks out mainly on two sides — upper left and lower right — where a powerful jet from the massive protostar has cleared away the dust.

"Star light, star bright 🌟⁣ ⁣ A densely-packed globular cluster lies about 157,000 light-years from Earth in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) captured by @NASAHubble. Globular clusters are very stable, tightly bound clusters of thousands or even millions of stars. Their stability means that they can last a long time, and therefore globular clusters are often studied to investigate potentially very old stellar populations. ⁣ ⁣ Research from 2017 estimates that this globular cluster probably clocks in at around 11.6 billion years old. Even though this is only a couple billion years younger than the universe itself – this globular is the youngest cluster in their sample. All of the LMC globular clusters studied in the same work were found to be older, with four of them over 13 billion years old. ⁣ ⁣ This globular cluster is as interesting as it is beautiful with its highly concentrated population of stars. The night sky would look very different from the perspective of an inhabitant of a planet orbiting one of the stars in a globular cluster’s center: the sky would appear to be stuffed full of stars, in a stellar environment that is thousands of times more crowded than our own.⁣ ⁣ Image Description: A dense cluster of stars.

"A sea of mystery. ⁣ ⁣ This spiral galaxy, found 220 million light-years from Earth (and seen here by @NASAHubble), is known as a ""jellyfish"" galaxy because of the blue ribbons of stars that trail from it like cosmic tentacles. When viewed in X-ray light, though, an even longer tail of hot gas emerges which extends across 260,000 light-years of space—shown here in purplish-blue with data from @NASAChandraXRay.⁣ ⁣ The newly-forming stars in the tail are a mystery to astronomers. Galaxies that live in a cluster tend to stop forming new stars sooner than galaxies outside of clusters. The “jellyfish” galaxy in the cluster is getting pulled in by the cluster’s gravity which causes the gas to act like wind and can remove the gas and dust in a process called “ram pressure stripping”. ⁣ ⁣ Since galaxies need gas to form stars, this will then slow the process of star formation. Astronomers hope to learn how the stripping process changed over time and how that affected conditions to form new stars.⁣ ⁣ Image description: A bright blue light, encircled by translucent blue swirls, rockets toward the upper left of the image, leaving two long blue ribbons of young stars dangling from the galaxy’s disk like cosmic tentacles.

"I wanna dance with somebody 💃⁣ ⁣ This dance between two galaxies captured by @NASAHubble. Interacting gravitationally toward one another, these galaxies lie about 500 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Tucana. ⁣ ⁣ The interacting galaxy pair is known as Arp-Madore, which is a collection of peculiar galaxies. What is peculiar about this group? There are actually three galaxies, not just two. If you look at the smaller galaxy’s upper arm on the lower right corner of the image, you can spot the knot-like structure. As seen from Earth’s perspective, astronomers have found it challenging to differentiate whether an object in space is one, or multiple objects, or lying in front of another. Astronomers discovered the third knot-like galaxy by analyzing the speed and direction which revealed that the redshift, the wavelength of light is seen “shifted” towards the red part of the spectrum making it its own entity. ⁣ ⁣ Image description:  Two spiral galaxies. Each glows brightly in the center, where a bar stretches from side to side. The upper one is rounder, and its arms form two thin rings. The lower galaxy is flatter and its arms make one outer ring; a dusty knot atop its upper arm marks out a third object. Gravity is pulling gas and dust together where the galaxies come close. A number of small galaxies surround them on a black background.⁣ ⁣ Credit: ESA/Hubble and NASA, J. Dalcanton, Dark Energy Survey/ DOE/ FNAL/ NOIRLab/ NSF/ AURA; Acknowledgement: L.

"It’s NICER in the witching hour 🧙‍♀️⁣ ⁣ This image of the whole sky shows 22 months of X-ray data recorded by NASA's Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) payload aboard the International Space Station (@ISS) during its nighttime slews between targets. ⁣ ⁣ NICER’s primary goals require that it target and track cosmic sources as the space station orbits the Earth every 93 minutes. But when the Sun sets and night falls on the orbital outpost, the NICER team keeps its detectors active while the instrument goes from one target to another, which can occur eight times each orbit. ⁣ ⁣ Each arc traces X-rays, as well as occasional strikes from energetic particles, captured during these night moves.

"Taking flight 🚀⁣ ⁣ The #MissionToPsyche is on its way to a metal-rich asteroid also named Psyche.⁣ ⁣ The Psyche spacecraft launched aboard a @SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on Friday, Oct. 13, at 10:19 a.m. EDT (14:19 UTC) from Launch Complex 39A @NASAKennedy in Florida. Psyche has acquired full communication, and initial telemetry shows the spacecraft is in good health.⁣ ⁣ This is our first mission to a metal world. According to scientific analysis, the asteroid Psyche is likely a mixture of rock and metal. Scientists think Psyche could be part of an early planetesimal, and can unlock secrets of how planets form and evolve. Since we can’t bore a path to the Earth’s core (or that of other rocky planets), Psyche could provide us with a one-of-a-kind window into the origins of the Solar System.⁣ ⁣ So long Psyche, and good luck on your six year, 2.2-billion-mile journey.

"Jupiter really hits the spot⁣ ⁣ The largest moon in the solar system, Jupiter's moon Ganymede, casts a large shadow on the gas giant as it passes between the planet and the Sun. Eclipses occur more often on Jupiter because it has four large moons and many more smaller moons, which frequently pass between the Sun and the planet. In a week's time, Ganymede transits once, Europa passes twice, and Io passes four times. Our #JunoMission captured this image as it soared 44,000 miles (71,000 km) over Jupiter's clouds, 15 times closer than Ganymede.⁣ ⁣ There are four types of solar eclipses: total solar eclipses occur when a moon passes between the Sun and a planet, completely blocking the face of the Sun. Annular solar eclipses happen when a moon passes between the Sun and a planet but at the moon's farthest point, not entirely blocking the Sun's surface. Hybrid solar eclipses occur when the eclipse shifts between annular and total as the shadow moves across the globe. Partial solar eclipses happen when a moon passes between the Sun and a planet, but only part of the Sun is covered.⁣ ⁣ On Earth, two eclipses will happen in the next few months, an annular and total. The annular eclipse will occur on Oct. 14, 2023, and will be visible (with solar-safe glasses!) in the United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. The total eclipse will occur on April 8, 2024, and be visible in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.⁣ ⁣ Image descriptions: Juno's image is split in two, and shows a large black spot shading Jupiter on the left side of the image.

"Standin’ in the light of your halo⁣ ⁣ Pluto's hazy, extremely thin atmosphere is captured by our New Horizons spacecraft from 120,000 miles (200,000 km) above the dwarf planet's surface as the spacecraft flew past. Scientists speculate that the haze is a photochemical smog as sunlight and molecules like methane interact, producing complex hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons accumulate into small particles, a fraction of a micrometer in size, and scatter sunlight to make the bright blue haze seen in this image.⁣ ⁣ Pluto's mountains can be seen in the top left of the first image silhouetted against the atmosphere, creating streaks of light similar to those seen on Earth near dawn and dusk, despite the dwarf planet's distance from the Sun. While Pluto is about 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers) away from the Sun on average, its atmosphere extends when it nears the Sun and may freeze when it travels farther away. From 1979 to 1999, Pluto was closer to the Sun than Neptune.⁣ ⁣ Image descriptions:⁣ ⁣ Image 1: The blue arc of Pluto's atmosphere and surface carves through black space from the bottom left to the upper right.

"Quoth the raven “Nevermore.” 🐦‍⬛⁣ ⁣ Once upon a midnight dreary, the @NASAWebb telescope captured this haunting view of star-forming region NGC 346 in mid-infrared light. The creepy blue tendrils that make up this “raven” represent dusty silicates and sooty chemical molecules, while the red glow represents warm dust heated by the brightest and most massive stars at the heart of the region. This area is also abundant with baby stars still embedded in their dusty cocoons.⁣ ⁣ NGC 346 is part of the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. It has a composition much closer to that of galaxies from the early universe and possesses fewer heavy elements. Accordingly, scientists did not expect much cosmic dust, which is formed by heavy elements. However, both Webb’s new mid-infrared look at NGC 346 and its past near-infrared view (released Jan. 2023) show plenty of dust! Learn more at @NASAWebb's link in bio.⁣ ⁣ Image descriptions:⁣ ⁣ 1.

"Don't you love New York in the fall?⁣ ⁣ Sept. 23 marks the first full day of fall in the Northern Hemisphere in 2023, and spring in the Southern Hemisphere. In autumn, shortened daylight and temperature drops trigger plants to slow and stop the production of chlorophyll, the molecule that plants use to synthesize food, causing them to change colors. Earth-observing satellite Landsat 9 captured this process in the Adirondack Mountains in 2022.⁣ ⁣ Each planet in our solar system has seasons, though they vary in length and intensity, the length of season is determined by the degree of tilt as the planet orbits the Sun. As Earth orbits around our solar system, its 23.4-degree axis tilt points the poles toward the Sun, creating the four seasons.⁣ ⁣ Seasons on some of the planets in our solar system are barely noticeable owing to their distance to the Sun and relative tilt. Venus has a very slight tilt, and seasons last around 56 days with no large changes to the weather. Seasons on Neptune are a different story due to a similar axial tilt as Earth, each of Neptune's four seasons last for over 40 years.⁣ ⁣ Image description: An aerial view of a sprawling forest below with white clouds dotting the Adirondack Mountains.

"Not all those who wander are lost 💍⁣ ⁣ The sixth planet from the Sun, Saturn, displays its rings' subtle colors in this view captured from our Cassini spacecraft  at a distance of 1.27 million miles (2.05 million km) from the center of the rings. Cassini launched in 1997 and arrived at Saturn in 2004, traveling 2.1 billion miles (3.4 billion km), and studied the gas giant and its moons until 2017, when it purposefully plunged into the planet's atmosphere, sending scientific data along the way.⁣ ⁣ While Saturn is not the only planet with rings, no other planet in our solar system has a ring system as complex and prominent as Saturn's. The gas giant's rings extend 175,000 miles (282,000 km) from the planet, made from mostly ice and rock particles that can range from dust-sized to as large as mountains.

"Time after time 🪩⁣ ⁣ The Eta Carinae star system gives a front row seat to a stellar eruption that continues to expand at speeds up to 4.5 million miles per hour (7.2 million km per hour).⁣ ⁣ The ""Great Eruption"" seen on Earth in the 19th century produced a dense pair of spherical clouds on opposite sides of the system's two stars. Those clouds are now called the Homunculus Nebula.⁣ ⁣ This composite image and new video reveal important hints about Eta Carinae's volatile history.

The explosion is shaped like an hourglass, or peanut shell, with bulbous ends and a narrow middle. The shell is a translucent mauve color, streaked with purple veins. Inside, at the narrow middle, a brilliant white light gleams brightly. This is the same orientation as the orange ring of gas. That indicates that both structures have the same origin: the ""Great Eruption,"" observed about 180 years ago.⁣ ⁣ 2.

"Artemis II crew, prepare for take off ✈️  With Johnson Space Center being the home of astronaut training, the Artemis II crew is preparing for their mission around the Moon and back through T-38 flight training at Ellington Airfield in Houston.   The T-38 is a two-engine jet that can hold two crew members together and reach speeds as high as Mach 1.2, making it faster than the speed of sound. The T-38, which can fly to heights of 50,000 feet/15,240 meters, is used for aerobatic maneuvers to help the astronauts become adjusted to unusual attitudes that they might experience in space. They also manage real risks in real time that helps prepare for quick decision making in the harsh environment of space. Since the Apollo era, astronauts have received dedicated training in the T-38.  Working together in flight is similar to how the crew might work together in their Orion spacecraft. The Artemis II mission will send @NASAastronauts @Astro_Reid, @AstroVicGlover, and @astro_christina, and @CanadianSpaceAgency astronaut @AstroJeremy on a 10-day flight test around the Moon. This first crewed mission back to the Moon will set the tone as we look forward to establishing a long term presence on the lunar surface with #Artemis.

"They call me Mister Fahrenheit (Celsius) 🌡️⁣ ⁣ Slightly larger than Earth’s Moon, Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system, and is the closest to the Sun at an average of 36 million miles (58 million km) away. While Mercury may be the smallest planet, it is also the speediest, traveling in its orbit at almost 29 miles (47 km) per second, making a year on Mercury just 88 Earth days. This view of Mercury was captured by MESSENGER, the first spacecraft to ever orbit the planet, which collected color enhanced maps to distinguish chemical, mineralogical, and physical differences in rocks on the planets surface.⁣ ⁣ Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury has a thin exosphere composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. Due to its lack of atmosphere and proximity to the Sun, daytime and night time on Mercury swing dramatically in temperature ranging from 800ºF (430ºC) during the day to -290 ºF (-180 ºC) at night. Mercury’s comparatively weak magnetic field compared to Earth, at just 1% strength of our own, interacts with solar winds creating magnetic tornados that tear across the planet’s surface.⁣ ⁣ Image description: Mercury appears tan and several shades of blue, with craters marking the surface, allowing scientists to examine the geological features.⁣ ⁣ Credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Carnegie Institution of Washington⁣ ⁣ #Queen #Mercury #NASA #SolarSystem #MESSENGER #Space #Craters",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CxBHeySuOj7/,post_569.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-4_XcGzzGIj7oKAws47y11CGJeFwxwWV

"If we could take a baby picture of our Sun, it might look something like this. 👶  Seen in this @NASAWebb image is a newborn star with supersonic jets of gas spewing from its poles. It’s only a few tens of thousands of years old here, but when it grows up, it’ll be much like our Sun.  Bright regions around newborn stars, as seen here, are called Herbig-Haro objects. This specific Herbig-Haro object is called Herbig-Haro (HH) 211. At roughly 1,000 light-years away from Earth, it’s one of the youngest and nearest objects of its type.   Herbig-Haro objects are created when jets of gas from these newborn stars form shockwaves as they collide with surrounding gas and dust. Webb’s sensitive infrared vision can pierce through the gas and dust, picking up on the heat emissions from the star’s outflows and mapping out structure in unprecedented detail. Interestingly, Webb observations have also shown that the outflows from this object are slower in comparison to that of more developed baby stars. More at @NASAWebb’s link in bio!

"The power of three will let us see   @nasahubble, Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory worked together to display this dazzling portion of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), also known as the Wing. In this composite image, the Chandra data is shown in purple, optical data from Hubble is shown in red, green, and blue, and infrared data from Spitzer is shown in red.   The SMC is a small galaxy about 200,000 light-years away that orbits our own Milky Way spiral galaxy: it’s one of our closest galactic neighbors.

"Mars: Is it all it's cracked up to be?⁣  Our Curiosity Mars rover spotted distinctive hexagonal mud cracks that scientists speculate may offer the first evidence of wet-dry cycles on Mars. One of the prevailing theories as to how life began on Earth is that persistent cycles of wet and dry conditions on land helped kickstart the complex chemical building blocks necessary for microbial life.⁣ ⁣ Curiosity spotted these mud cracks as it ascended between the sedimentary layers of Mount Sharp in a transitional zone, between a clay-rich layer and an enriched salty mineral region higher up. Transitional zones offer records depicting when long dry periods became prevalent, and rivers and lakes began to recede. The hexagonal patterns occur as the mud dries, shrinking and fracturing into T-shape junctions. When the junctions are repeatedly exposed to water, the T-junctions soften and become Y-shaped, eventually forming hexagons.⁣ ⁣ Mars is no stranger to cracks big and small.

"Channeling Venus by being hot and toxic⁣. ⁣ Second planet from the Sun, Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system with surface temperatures reaching around 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius). The planet's extreme heat is due to runaway greenhouse gas effect, as Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere mainly composed of carbon dioxide and shrouded in clouds of sulfuric acid.⁣ ⁣ About the size and density of Earth, Venus is covered in vast mountain ranges and thousands of large volcanoes that scientists believe may have resurfaced the planet, erasing the early remnants of its surface 350 to 750 million years ago.

"Who doesn’t love a little chaos?  The stars in this galaxy may look chaotically scattered through the sky, but they’re all held together by gravity. This is an irregular dwarf galaxy, meaning that it doesn’t have a distinctive structure or shape and doesn’t have much dust.  Astronomers often see irregular galaxies as they peer deeply into the universe. These galaxies are abundant in the early universe, in the era before spirals and ellipticals developed. As irregular galaxies collide and merge with other galaxies throughout time, they are thought to develop structure and become the spiral and elliptical galaxies we see in today’s universe.  At just over 14 million light-years away in the Coma Berenices constellation, it is relatively close to us, allowing us to see many of the individual stars within its bounds. There’s a mix of red and blue stars sprinkled throughout, which tells us that stars have been forming in this galaxy throughout its history. The blue stars are bright, hot, and massive stars that have formed relatively recently, while red stars are much older.  Image description: A thick smear of glittery stars makes up the irregular dwarf galaxy NGC 4789A. Most of the white, red, blue, and yellow stars are gathered in the same general area, though they start to spread away from each other at the edges.

"What’d you do last weekend? 🌞  On Sun-day (get it?), July 2, 2023, the Sun emitted a strong solar flare. Our ever-watchful Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) captured this image of the event.  Solar flares are powerful bursts of energy that can temporarily affect radio communications, power grids, and navigation signals. This doesn’t happen often, though.  This solar flare was an X1.0 flare. X-class are the most intense flares, while the number gives more information about its strength. By studying flares and how they affect our planet and nearby space, SDO helps us to better prepare for and mitigate these potential disruptions.  NASA works as a research arm of the United States’ space weather effort. We watch the Sun and our space environment constantly with a fleet of spacecraft that study everything from the Sun’s activity to the solar atmosphere, and to the particles and magnetic fields in the space surrounding Earth.

"We've got our eyes on Orion ⁣ ⁣ While observing the Orion Bar, the James Webb Space Telescope made the first detection ever of a crucial carbon molecule called methyl cation (pronounced cat-eye-on) in space. Carbon compounds are the foundation of life as we know it, and methyl cation (CH3+) plays an important role in forming more complex carbon-based molecules.⁣ ⁣ Within this region, @NASAWebb found methyl cation in a planet-forming disk surrounding a young star system. The disk was bombarded with UV radiation from nearby young stars. While UV radiation is typically expected to destroy complex carbon molecules, the science team predicts that it might actually have provided the source of energy necessary for methyl cation — and with it, more complex carbon molecules — to form. Ultimately, understanding how UV radiation changes the chemistry of these disks could tell us more about the origins of life.⁣ ⁣ Image description: Billowy, multi-hued clouds fill the field of view.

"You’ve never seen Mars like this. 👀  Our MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) mission got some stunning tie-dye views of Mars in these two ultraviolet images. MAVEN took the first image in July 2022 during the southern hemisphere’s summer season, which occurs when Mars passes closest to the Sun. The second image is of Mars’ northern hemisphere and was taken in January 2023 after Mars had passed the farthest point in its orbit from the Sun.  MAVEN has a special instrument that lets us see Mars in ultraviolet wavelengths called the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph, or IUVS. Viewing the planet with IUVS can give us insight into the atmosphere on Mars and let us see surface features in remarkable ways.  We can’t see ultraviolet wavelengths with our eyes, so these images are rendered with the varying brightness levels of three ultraviolet wavelength ranges represented as red, green, and blue. In this color scheme, atmospheric ozone appears purple, while clouds and hazes appear white or blue. The surface can appear tan or green, depending on how the images have been optimized to increase contrast and show detail.  Image description:  Image 1: Mars looks like it has been dyed in soft, muted yellows, greens, and purples. The deep canyons of Valles Marineris appear at top left filled with clouds (colored tan in this image). Argyre Basin, one of Mars’ deepest craters, appears at bottom left filled with atmospheric haze (shown here as pale pink). The southern polar ice cap is visible at bottom in white, shrinking from the relative warmth of summer.  Image 2: Here, Mars’ colors are much more vibrant. Ozone, which appears magenta in this UV view (at top), has built up during the northern winter’s chilly polar nights. White clouds appear in the north polar region, thanks to rapidly changing seasons. The rest of the planet is mostly green. Finally, the deep canyons of Valles Marineris can be seen in tan at lower left, along with many craters.  Credit: NASA/LASP/CU Boulder  #Mars #NASA #Tiedye #Color #Ultraviolet",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/Ct6vaiOO5Vs/,post_661.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14l7oXNESKGlhIy7PBm_N24lPHg97ODGi

"Looking with new eyes. 👀This part of the sky is called GOODS-South. It has been well-studied by @nasahubble and other observatories, revealing tens of thousands of galaxies. @nasawebb searched the same area and found hundreds of early galaxies that existed when the universe was less than 600 million years old—way more than were predicted in past observations.This discovery came from the James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, or JADES, program, which studies the universe to learn more about how the earliest galaxies and stars formed. Using Webb’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument, JADES found signatures of star formation showing that early galaxies created many hot, massive stars.JADES also found galaxies that existed during a time known as the Epoch of Reionization, when the universe underwent a transformation from opaque to transparent. For hundreds of millions of years after the big bang, the universe was filled with a gaseous fog that made it opaque. By one billion years after the big bang, the fog had cleared and the universe became transparent, thanks to the same star-forming early galaxies.Image description: Thousands of small galaxies are scattered on a black background.

"Don't feel bad if your to-do list keeps growing. The universe is expanding, too.⁣ ⁣ This image, made up of data from @NASAHubble and @NASAWebb telescopes, shows the spiral galaxy NGC 5584. It’s about 72 million light-years away from Earth. Among the glowing stars in the spiral galaxy are a special class of exploding stars called Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernova. Astronomers use these stars as markers to measure the universe’s expansion rate. The expansion rate is measured by the brightness of certain stars which tells us how far away they are. This helps us understand how much time this light traveled to reach us, while the red wavelengths of the galaxies tell us how much the universe expanded in that time.⁣ ⁣ Recent observations made by Webb have improved the precision of local measurements of the Hubble constant. The Hubble constant is known as the rate at which the universe is expanding. This is fundamental in understanding the evolution and ultimately the fate of the cosmos. Hubble can single out a crowded star, but Webb has sharper infrared vision that sees through the gas and dust. While Webb has cut the noise and shows improved resolution, the two telescopes are in excellent agreement about the accuracy of the measurements.⁣ ⁣ Image description: A spiral galaxy with a bright star at the center.

"Whatever floats your ‘scope ⁣ ⁣ The Super Pressure Balloon Imaging Telescope (SuperBIT) that launched on a scientific super pressure balloon on April 15, 2023, from New Zealand captured its first research images of the Tarantula and Antennae galaxies. Using a balloon-borne telescope, floating at 108,000 feet (32,918 meters) above Earth’s surface, allows scientists to view these scientific targets from a balloon platform in a near-space environment.⁣  ⁣ The SuperBIT telescope captures images of galaxies in the visible to near ultraviolet light spectrum, which is within the @NASAHubble capabilities, but with a wider field of view. The goal of the mission is to map dark matter around galaxy clusters by measuring the way these massive objects warp the space around them, also called “weak gravitational lensing.” ⁣ ⁣ Image descriptions: ⁣ ⁣ 1 – The Tarantula nebula is pictured in shades of red and magenta. It is a large star-forming region of ionized gas that lies 161,000 light-years from Earth in the Large Magellanic Cloud.  It has turbulent clouds of gas and dust that appear to swirl between the regions bright newly formed stars. ⁣ ⁣ 2- The Antennae Galaxies are two large galaxies colliding 60 million light-years away toward the southerly constellation Corvus.

"This is the way... we celebrate #StarWarsDay.   Swipe through to learn about locales in our solar system that share similarities to the fictional ones found in a galaxy far, far away.  Tatooine is known as the home of Luke Skywalker, and it's the site of many important events from a long, long time ago. In Star Wars lore, it orbits two suns, has rolling sand dunes, and is a haven for scum and villainy. Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, is not a wretched hive of scum and villainy, nor does it orbit two suns. But it does have rolling dunes comprised of coarse dark hydrocarbon grains that likely rained down and got everywhere on the moon.

With images like these, created using X-ray data from our Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and visible light from @NASAHubble, astronomers study how black holes interact when their galaxies collide. Here, the supermassive black hole in the galaxy on the right is consuming the galaxy on the left in a process called accretion.⁣ ⁣ Astronomers divide black holes into three categories, depending on their mass, with supermassive black holes being the largest. Black holes can be as ""small"" as a few times the mass of our Sun — or can be more massive than billions of our Suns combined. ⁣ ⁣ Image descriptions:⁣ ⁣ Image 1: Two swirling galaxies appear in blue, white, orange, and brown as they circle a center point near the middle of the image.

"Look at those two buddies. Just hanging out. Doing their thing.  This starry pair offers a glimpse of what our Milky Way galaxy would look like to an outside observer. The edge-on galaxy is called NGC 4302, and the tilted galaxy is NGC 4298. Like twinning pals, both of these galaxies are approximately 55 million light-years away, reside in the constellation Coma Berenices, and were discovered together in 1784 by astronomer William Herschel.  Although these galaxies look quite dissimilar from one another due to our perspective seeing them from different angles in the sky, they are very similar in structure and contents. Both galaxies are a little basic, as far as galaxies go. Being typical spiral galaxies, they have arms of young stars that wind outward from their centers. These bright arms are regions of intense star formation. Like other spiral galaxies, they have central bulges surrounded by a faint halo of stars and bars that extend from their central bulges to the arms.  Who is your cosmic best buddy?

(Links in bio.)⁣ ⁣ Tolar eclipses occur when the Sun, the Moon, and Earth fully or partially align, casting a shadow on our home planet and obscuring the bright face of our closest star. Remember, it is unsafe to look directly at the Sun for most of the eclipse without specialized eye protection.⁣ ⁣ There are several types of eclipses, total, annular, hybrid, and partial. In a total eclipse, the Moon entirely blocks the Sun allowing people in the eclipse's path to see the star's corona – outer atmosphere. Total eclipses are the only type where viewers can momentarily remove their eclipse glasses. In an annular eclipse, the Moon perfectly lines up with the Sun but is farther away from the surface of Earth and does not fully cover the Sun's face. Hybrid eclipses shift from annular to total due to our planet's curve. In partial eclipses, the Moon is not fully lined up with the Sun, only partially covering its bright face.⁣ ⁣ Image description: In the center of the image, a faint white outline of the Sun's corona appears behind the Moon as it is fully obscured during a total eclipse in 2017.

"Picking up the TEMPO 🏃‍♀️   On April 7 at 12:30 a.m. EDT (0430 UTC), our @NASAEarth and @Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) mission launched into orbit atop a @SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.   Only the size of a dishwasher, it’s powerful enough to observe air pollutants hour-by-hour throughout the day across North America down to a resolution of 4 square miles (10 square km) — far better than existing limits of about 100 square miles (258 square km).   It will dramatically improve the scientific data record on air pollution — including ozone, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and formaldehyde — throughout the region. TEMPO’s data will play an important role in the scientific analysis of pollution, including studies of rush hour pollution, the potential for improved air quality alerts, the effects of lightning on ozone, the movement of pollution from forest fires and volcanoes, and even the effects of fertilizer application.

"Look how they shine for you. 🤩  Auroras are natural light shows caused by magnetic storms triggered by the Sun’s activity like explosive flares and coronal mass ejections (ejected gas bubbles). Solar winds carry the energetically charged particles from these events to Earth’s atmosphere.   When these particles seep through Earth's magnetosphere, a part of our atmosphere that protects us from solar and cosmic radiation, they cause substorms. These fast-moving substorm particles slam into our thin, high atmosphere, colliding with Earth's oxygen and nitrogen particles. As these air particles shed the energy they picked up from the collision, each atom starts to glow in a different color—causing the brilliant ribbons of light which weave across Earth's northern or southern polar regions.   Typically, auroras are visible closer to Earth’s poles, where the magnetosphere is generally weakest; however, when the Sun releases especially powerful solar storms, auroras can be seen further from the poles. Just that happened this past week when a powerful geomagnetic storm delighted skywatchers with auroras as far south as Virginia and Arizona!   Video description: The northern lights as seen from the International Space Station. The video begins with the green hues of the northern lights dancing across the skies of North America.

"How’s the weather up there? ⁣ ⁣ @NASAHubble has been keeping a close eye on our solar system’s gas giants.  The telescope has been monitoring Jupiter and Uranus and observing atmospheric changes taking place over time. Swipe through: ⁣ ⁣ 1. The forecast for Jupiter in Nov. 2022 has stormy weather at low northern altitudes. Cyclones and anticyclones lock together like in a machine with alternating gears moving clockwise and counterclockwise, a mechanism which prevents individual storms from merging or rivaling the Great Red Spot. Strong color differences indicate that Hubble is seeing different cloud heights and depths as well. The orange moon, Io, photobombs the view of Jupiter’s clouds, casting a shadow toward the planet’s western limb. Sulfur takes on various hues at different temperatures, giving Io’s surface its color. ⁣ ⁣ 2. Jupiter’s legendary Great Red Spot takes the center stage in this view. The vortex large enough to swallow Earth has shrunken to the smallest size it has ever been observed dating back 150 years. Jupiter’s icy moon Ganymede can be seen transiting the planet on the lower right. This image is smaller in size because Jupiter was 81,000 miles farther from Earth when the photo was taken. ⁣ ⁣ 3. Planetary oddball Uranus rolls on its side around the Sun as it follows an 84-year orbit. In this 2014 image, multiple storms with methane ice-crystal clouds appear at mid-northern latitudes above the planets cyan-tinted lower atmosphere with some faint cloud bands. ⁣ ⁣ 4. Uranus in 2022 shows a thickened photochemical haze over the north pole. Several little storms can be seen near the edge of the polar haze boundary.  As the Hubble tracks the size and brightness of the north polar cap, it continues to get brighter year after year. As the northern summer solstice approaches in 2028, the cap may grow brighter still and will be aimed directly at Earth, allowing good views of the rings and north pole. The Ring system will then appear face-on. ⁣ ⁣ Credit: NASA, ESA, STScI, Amy Simon (NASA-GSFC), and Michael H.

"Please let this be a normal field trip. With #Crew4? No way!  During their homecoming tour of DC this week, the astronauts of our Crew-4 mission to the @iss had a chance to take a field trip to the @airandspacemuseum There, they checked out a replica of the Space Station’s cupola.  While in orbit about 250 miles (402 km) above Earth, the crew spent many days peering out of the windows of the real cupola—arguably the best view on, or off, Earth. However, the cupola isn’t designed for just jaw-dropping views: this windowed section of the Space Station is also used by the crew when they’re controlling the robotic arms on the exterior of the station or when assisting in docking an approaching spacecraft.   The Earth-facing windows also provide a valuable perspective to catalog our changing planet. Since the 1960s, astronauts have taken over 1.5 million images of Earth, recording how the planet is changing over time.

"First discovered 368 years ago this week by Galileo, Saturn's largest moon – Titan – is the sole other place in the solar system known to have an earthlike cycle of liquids raining from clouds, flowing across its icy surface, filling lakes and seas, and evaporating back into the sky. Beneath the thick ice surface, evidence suggests there is a water ocean that could potentially harbor life. Primarily composed of nitrogen, Titan's thick atmosphere suggests the moon formed early in our solar system's history.⁣ ⁣ We are preparing to study the Earth-like moon in-depth with Dragonfly – an 8-bladed rotorcraft targeted for launch in 2027 and arrival at Titan in 2034, which will search for the building blocks of life.

"This cosmic object has a lot going on.   It's sometimes classified as an active galactic nucleus (AGN), sometimes as a quasar, and sometimes as a Seyfert galaxy. So what is it? The answer: it is all of these things — all at once.  For starters, an AGN is a small area in the center of some galaxies that is far brighter than the galaxy’s stars alone. The brightness is caused by a supermassive black hole heating matter that falls into it.  Quasars are a type of AGN. Typically they're both extremely bright and distant from Earth, but this one is ""only"" several hundred million light-years away. By astronomical standards, this quasar is a local. Still with us?  Ok. Lastly, an AGN is so bright that the rest of the galaxy cannot be seen. But Seyfert galaxies host extremely bright AGNs that can still make the rest of the galaxy observable. To recap: this image is of a Seyfert galaxy that contains a quasar, which hosts an AGN.  Any questions?  Image description: At the center of the image a Seyfert galaxy containing a quasar and active galactic nucleus is visible in bright dusty shades of blue, green, and yellow, swirling around a center point.

It's a chaotic mess of gases, shock waves, high-energy particles and magnetic fields, mixing and matching in a bizarre environment that's not yet thoroughly understood.  This image gives astronomers a look at the Crab Nebula like we've never seen it before, combining data from NASA's @chandraxray (in dark purple) with our recently-launched IXPE satellite (in magenta). IXPE is capable of studying the nebula's polarization to show us the orientation of its magnetic field—bringing us another step closer to unraveling this nebulous mystery.  Image description: A swirling sea of gas stands against the completely-black backdrop of space. Near the center, ill-defined concentric magenta circles are intersected by a stream of particles, making a bullseye at the nebula's core. Wisps of purple hang loosely near the nebula's edges.

"On April 8, our Juno spacecraft completed its 50th close approach of the largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter. After traveling 1.7 billion miles (2.7 billion km), the spacecraft arrived in the Jovian system (Jupiter, its moons, rings, and asteroids) in 2016, ready to study the planet’s atmosphere, magnetosphere, and structure.⁣ ⁣ By making close approaches to Jupiter, scientists may uncover breakthroughs about the origins of our solar system. This mosaic is a series of four images captured on Juno’s 20th close approach of the planet, from a distance between 11,600 miles (18,600 km) and 5,400 miles (8,600 km).⁣ ⁣ Image description: Swirling clouds dominate the face of Jupiter, which is partially shaded at the bottom of the image.

"Hurry up, we're dreaming 🌌⁣  The spiral galaxy M83 – known as the Southern Pinwheel – lies 15 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra and was first discovered by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1752. M83 is one of the brightest galaxies in the sky and can be seen with binoculars, most easily in May.⁣ ⁣ @NASAHubble captured this image of M83 with its hundreds of thousands of stars and thousands of star clusters, showing off the galaxy's spiral structure and revealing interstellar ""bubbles"" produced by supernova remnants.

"Wearing green? ✨  This image captured in 2009 by our retired Spitzer Space Telescope reveals a greenish mist illuminated by two bright stars. The fog is made of hydrogen and carbon compounds, which are found right here on Earth in sooty vehicle exhaust and on charred grills. However, in space, these compounds form in the dark clouds that give rise to stars.   These molecules provide astronomers with a way to visualize the boundaries of gas clouds and study their structures in great detail. This image revealed several small, blobby outflows of gas from nearby forming stars, which indicate their youth. Such outflows are a great way to target very young, massive stars in their earliest, hard-to-catch stages.  Image description: Distant stars are shrouded in a green-like mist, this cloud-like area is captured in infrared light, invisible to the naked human eye. To better visualize the raw infrared data experts color-coded the areas of concentrated hydrogen and carbon compounds in green. In the top left of the shroud, strange streaks—likely dust grains that lined up with magnetic fields—distort a star. The fairly close, well-studied star GL 490 gleams in the middle right of the shroud. Stars in the background of the image are seen in green, red, and blue—the different colors caused by the telescope sensors warming and detecting light at different infrared wavelengths as its liquid coolant ran dry.

"Recent volcanic activity has been observed on Venus for the first time.⁣ ⁣ After scouring archival radar images taken by our Magellan mission more than 30 years ago, the @uaf.gi and @nasajpl team found direct geological evidence of an active volcano on the surface of Earth’s twin planet. The images revealed a volcanic vent changing shape and increasing significantly in size in less than a year.⁣ ⁣ The volcanic vent studied appeared nearly circular, covering an area of less than 1 square mile (2.2 square kilometers). It had steep interior sides and showed signs of drained lava down its exterior slopes, factors that hinted at activity. In radar images captured eight months later, the same vent had doubled in size and become misshapen. It also appeared to be filled to the rim with a lava lake.⁣ ⁣ Scientists study active volcanoes to understand how a planet’s interior can shape its crust, drive its evolution, and affect its habitability. The new findings set the stage for our upcoming orbiter mission VERITAS – short for Venus Emissivity, Radio science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy – which will do just that when it launches within a decade.⁣ ⁣ Image description:⁣ ⁣ A computer-generated 3D image shows the entirety of Venus in a bright yellow color. There are patches of darker yellows that illustrate differences in the surface. The large circular planet has a black square to the middle-right section marking where volcanic activity was spotted in archival radar images from NASA's Magellan mission.⁣ 	⁣ A computer-generated 3D model image shows Venus’ surface and the summit of Maat Mons, a volcano exhibiting signs of activity. A new study found one of Maat Mons’ vents became enlarged and changed shape over an eight-month period in 1991, indicating an eruptive event occurred. The 3D rendering shows a yellow-covered surface and a black background.

"Shining, shimmering, splendid✨This image of Earth at night provides a clear view of the patterns of human settlements across our planet.Satellite images of Earth at night – often referred to as “night lights” – provide a broad beautiful picture showing how humans shaped the planet and lit up the darkness.The image shows Earth’s night lights as observed in 2016; it is drawn from a compositing technique that selected the best cloud-free nights in each month over each land mass in 2016. (Note that clouds and sunlight are added for aesthetic effect.)“Using this data, we can monitor short-term changes caused by disturbances in power delivery, such as conflict, storms, earthquakes, and brownouts. We can monitor cyclical changes driven by reoccurring human activities such as holiday lighting and seasonal migrations. We can also monitor gradual changes driven by urbanization, out-migration, economic changes, and electrification. The fact that we can track all these different aspects at the heart of what defines a city is simply mind-boggling.” – former @NASAEarth scientist, Miguel Román.Image Description:The outline of Earth glows in light blue, while the city lights of Europe and northern Africa shine bright.Credit: NASA Earth Observatory images by Joshua Stevens, using Suomi NPP VIIRS data from Miguel Román, NASA GSFC.#NASA #NASAEarth #Earth #EarthAtNight #NightLights #CityLights #Glow #Space",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CqGnEhlpKJT/,post_753.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1WN3hOKn5nAaJG9WAtrV7fr4NBfzh_PMS
"Welcome home, Crew-5! 🚀  After five months on the @ISS, the four members of NASA's @SpaceX #Crew5 mission—including @NASAAstronauts Nicole Mann and @astro_cassada—safely returned to Earth last weekend. Crew-5 and their Dragon Endurance spacecraft splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico at 9:02 p.m. EST on Saturday, March 11 (0202 UTC March 12).  Over their 157 days in space, Crew-5 orbited the Earth more than 2,500 times, went on five spacewalks, and contributed to more than 100 scientific experiments and scientific demonstrations. Our astronauts grew protein crystals for medical research, tended our ""space garden"" to prepare for distant long-term missions, talked with children (and adults) around the world, and helped prep a new set of roll-up solar arrays to boost the power of our orbiting laboratory.  After being retrieved by recovery teams from SpaceX and NASA, Crew-5 arrived in Houston earlier today (March 13). Our Crew-6 astronauts, who lifted off from @NASAKennedy earlier this month, have taken their place on the ISS, starting our latest science expedition to help humanity reach new heights.

"Lightning storms and star trails ⚡⁣  ⁣ The views from the International Space Station (@ISS) are incredible – but traveling at a speed at about 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 km/hour) can make it challenging to capture photos, making it easy to lose focus or become distorted. ⁣  ⁣ However, that same motion makes it possible to shoot photos like the one above.

"Saturn is in its messy era 🪐  Data from @NASAHubble, the @NASASolarsystem Cassini mission, and the twin Voyager spacecraft reveal that small sections of Saturn’s rings are falling into and heating its atmosphere.  The leading explanation is that icy ring particles raining down onto Saturn's atmosphere cause this heating. This could be due to the impact of micrometeorites, solar wind particle bombardment, solar ultraviolet radiation, or electromagnetic forces picking up electrically charged dust.  There is no cause for alarm though—although Saturn’s iconic rings are slowly falling they’ve got another 100 million years of life in them. Ultimately, this unexpected interaction between Saturn and its rings could provide scientists with a tool for predicting if planets around other stars have glorious Saturn-like ring systems, too.  Image description: A image of Saturn as seen in near-ultraviolet by the Hubble Space Telescope. Saturn appears an ombre of blue and purple, its rings appearing much darker than the planet's body as they reflect much less ultraviolet sunlight. Above the rings and the dark equatorial region of Saturn, a bulge appears as an extended band of white that is 30 percent brighter than the surrounding light blue regions. It's believed that icy ring particles raining on the atmosphere cause atmospheric heating that makes the upper atmosphere reflect more ultraviolet sunlight in the bulge region. The poles of Saturn are bathed in white hues, caused by the thinner atmosphere in this region which also causes auroras. The background of this image is the blackness of space.

"Scientists have long suspected Jupiter's moon, Europa, of having a massive ocean swirling around its rocky interior under its icy shell. New research may indicate why the icy shell rotates at a different rate than its interior. Using computer modeling, astronomers believe the water may be pushing the ice shell at different rates speeding up and slowing down the icy shell over time.  The ebb and flow of the ocean may also explain the geology seen on the moon's surface, creating cracks, ridges, and cliffs as seen here by our Juno spacecraft. Scientists hope to learn more about Europa's unique make-up with our Europa-Clipper set to launch in October 2024, which will study the moon in-depth.

"Rocket flying high, You know how I feel; Sun in the sky, You know how I feel ☀️⁣ ⁣ Known as the March equinox, the vernal equinox brings the first day of Spring in the Northern Hemisphere and the first day of Autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. During the equinox (Latin for “equal night”), the Sun passes directly over the equator bringing nearly equal amounts of day and night on all parts of Earth.⁣ ⁣ The reason for the seasons, scientists believe, occurred when our planet was young. A large object, about the size of Mars, collided with Earth, causing it to tilt off-kilter relative to the position of the Sun, creating four seasons, and the debris formed our Moon. As we plan future missions to the Moon with #Artemis, we may gain a better understanding of how our cosmic neighbor formed by studying its lunar geology.⁣ ⁣ Image description: Green grass and wildflowers dominate the bottom of this image, which shows the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and mobile launcher at @NASAKennedy’s Launch pad 39B.

"When the Moon is away, the stars take the stage. ⁣ ⁣ Take a step outside tonight (Tuesday, March 21, 2023) for a new appreciation for the night sky with a new moon. The best time to observe the stars, with regard to the Moon's brightness, is the two weeks before and after the new moon phase. On these evenings the Moon is either absent from the sky all night, or sets within a couple of hours after sunset, or doesn't rise until the pre-dawn hours.⁣ ⁣ Other stargazing tips: ⁣ -	Look for dark skies away from city lights to see more stars. This is especially true if you want to be able to see the Milky Way. There are many more faint stars in the sky than bright ones, and only the brightest stars and planets are brilliant enough to see in bright, urban skies.⁣ -	Being at higher altitude helps, because you'll be above the dense air at low altitudes that contains hazes, fog, and smoke that mask your view of the stars. If you can safely get to a viewing location a couple thousand feet above the surrounding area, it can make for clearer skies.⁣ -	Finally, allow time for your eyes to become dark adapted. It can take half an hour or more for your vision to become fully sensitive to the low-light environment. Be especially careful about stumbling around in the dark when you first arrive, or after you turn on a light, even briefly. Protect your night vision by minimizing the use of bright mobile devices and flashlights and use only ultra-dim light sources if you can.⁣ ⁣ ⁣ Image description: A 30-second exposure taken with a circular fish-eye lens, a meteor streaks across the sky as a photographer wipes moisture from the camera lens.

"Cosmic Lighthouse ⛯  About 10,000 years ago, light from the explosion of a giant star arrived at Earth. This supernova left behind a dense object called a pulsar, which appears to brighten regularly as it spins, like a cosmic lighthouse beacon.   This phenomenon is caused by winds of particles on the surface of the pulsar that emerge and travel near the speed of light, creating a chaotic hodgepodge of charged particles and magnetic fields that crash into surrounding gas.   Using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) to measure this pulsar’s polarization, which has to do with how electromagnetic waves are organized, scientists are getting an unprecedented understanding of how a cosmic object like a pulsar accelerates particles to high speeds.   Image description:  A pulsar wind nebula. A hazy blue halo in the center of the image reveals X-ray polarization data from IXPE. From the halo, a faint blue fuzzy line points to the upper right-hand corner, revealing a jet of high-energy particles shooting out from the pulsar at about half the speed of light. Pink X-ray ""arcs"" form the edges of a donut-shaped region around the blue halo, these arcs are where the pulsar wind shocks and accelerates high-energy particles. At the center of the colorful halo, a small white circle marks the location of the pulsar. Pink and purple hues washout the edges of the halo, representing data from @NASAChandraXray.

Mission pilot @astro.woody, who's on his first mission to outer space, and the rest of Crew-6 will dock with the @ISS early Friday morning (1:17 a.m. EST, 0617 UTC), joining the seven-member crew already aboard the orbiting laboratory.  Over the next six months, they'll run hundreds of experiments to help humanity learn how to live in space while making life better back on Earth—including research into the human immune system and studies examining microbes that could survive in the harsh environment of outer space.   Our Commercial Crew missions (like Crew-6) are also helping make spaceflight more reliable and less expensive, opening up access to outer space and preparing us for future missions to the Moon and Mars.

Almost entirely pure ice, a small percent of the ring’s mass is made up of non-icy “pollution” from micrometeoroids, such as asteroid fragments smaller than a grain of sand. These constantly collide with other ring particles, further contributing material circling the planet. Three recent studies by @NASAAmes researchers and their science partners provide evidence that the rings are a relatively recent addition to Saturn and that they may last only another few hundred million years.⁣ ⁣ Though Saturn’s rings may be short-lived, we can be grateful to be a species born at a time when Saturn was dressed to the nines, a planetary fashion icon for us to behold and study.⁣ ⁣ Image description: A black-and-white view of Saturn from the Cassini orbiter, captured on May 4, 2014.

"This is the largest known spiral galaxy. 🌌  This image processed in 2013 reveals a colossal galaxy. At roughly 522,000 light-years from tip-to-tip across its two outsized spiral arms, this galaxy is more than five times the size of the entire Milky Way.   This cosmic behemoth’s unusual size and appearance stem from its gravitational interaction with a much smaller disk galaxy, which is only about one-fifth of its mass. This odd duo is located 212 million light-years from Earth in the southern constellation Pavo.  To crown this galaxy as the largest yet, astronomers combined visible light images from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope with archived far-ultraviolet data from NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer and infrared data acquired by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.   Image description: A composite image of a giant barred spiral galaxy. In the center of the image, a large spiral-shaped galaxy dominates outwards in shades of yellow, red, and blue. The large galaxy's center shines brightest in light yellow, its two blueish spiral tails extending far into space. Visible as an oblong disk above the large galaxy, a smaller galaxy can be seen, its gravitational effect stretching and disrupting the larger of the two galaxies. In the upper left of the image, the faint ultraviolet glow of new star birth within a tidal dwarf galaxy can barely be made out as a bloom of misty blue atop the deep blackness of space.

"All for one, and one for all! 🌌  This spectacular trio of merging galaxies in the constellation Boötes (pronounced “boo-OH-tees”) was captured by @nasahubble. These three galaxies are destined for a dynamic future; set on a collision course with one another, they will eventually merge into a single larger galaxy, distorting and recrafting their shapes in the process.  This trio is a relatively rare combination of three large star-forming galaxies lying within only 50,000 light-years of one another. While that might sound like a safe distance, for galaxies this makes them extremely close neighbors.   This image was captured while on the lookout for Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) which—as the name suggests—are defined as the brightest galaxies in any given galaxy cluster. Astronomers suspect that BCGs form through the merger of large, gas-rich galaxies like the ones seen here.

"Humanity first spotted this supernova in 1572. 📅   This supernova remnant is called Tycho, named for Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, who noticed the bright glow of this new “star” in the constellation Cassiopeia 451 years ago.  New observations by our Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) have built upon past data collected by @nasachandraxray. IXPE’s findings revealed, for the first time, the geometry of the magnetic fields close to the shock wave. Understanding the magnetic field geometry allows scientists to address some of the biggest questions in astrophysics, such as how Tycho and other objects accelerate particles closer to the speed of light than the most powerful particle accelerators on Earth.   The Tycho supernova blast itself released as much energy as the Sun would put out  over the course of 10 billion years. That brilliance rendered the Tycho supernova visible to the naked eye here on Earth in 1572, when it was spotted by Brahe and other stargazers, potentially including an 8-year-old William Shakespeare, who would go on to describe it in an early passage of “Hamlet” at the turn of the 17th century.

"Since its discovery – 93 years ago today – dwarf planet Pluto has yet to make a complete orbit around the Sun. Pluto’s distant elliptical and tilted orbit takes it as far as 49 times the distance of Earth from the Sun, a measure of distance known as an astronomical unit. On average Pluto is 39 AU or 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers) away from the center of our solar system. Like Venus and Uranus, Pluto rotates in a retrograde manner, and a day on Pluto takes 153 hours.⁣ ⁣ The dwarf planet’s complex surface is covered in craters, mountains, plains, and valleys, which lie beneath a thin atmosphere that expands when Pluto gets closer to the Sun and collapses when it moves farther away, contributing to its frigid temperatures that range from -375 to -400 degrees Fahrenheit (-226 to -240 degrees Celsius). ⁣ ⁣ Our New Horizons spacecraft captured this image at a distance of 120,000 miles (200,000 kilometers) from Pluto, capturing the dwarf planet with its Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) and Ralph/Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC).

As a galaxy impacts these gases, they serve like a blast of wind, stripping gas and dust from the galaxy and creating the trail of debris that adorns JW100.  This observation took advantage of Hubble’s advanced capabilities. The data is part of a series of observations designed to explore star formation in the tentacles of jellyfish galaxies. These tentacles represent star formation under extreme conditions and could help astronomers better understand the process of star formation elsewhere in the universe.  Image description: A collection of galaxies, to the right of the image, one galaxy prominently resembles a jellyfish with its tentacles dangling in shades of yellow, blue, and green. Toward the top of this image are two bright yellow blotches surrounded by a remarkably bright area of diffuse light. These galaxies likely grow by consuming smaller galaxies, so it’s not unusual for them to have multiple nuclei since it can take a long time for their cores to be absorbed. The bright points of light studding the galaxy’s outer fringes are a rich population of globular star clusters. The remainder of the image is sprinkled with stars and distant galaxies against the blackness of space.   Credit: ESA/Hubble & NASA, M.

"Everyone, Everywhere, All at Once. 🌎  This “pale blue dot” captured by our Voyager 1 spacecraft shows our home, Planet Earth, from about 3.7 billion miles (6 billion km) away. Taken 33 years ago today, this was one of Voyager 1’s last sights; mere minutes later, the spacecraft’s cameras were deactivated to preserve power.   The popular name of this image comes from astronomer Carl Sagan, who originated the idea of using Voyager's cameras to photograph the distant Earth and other planets, playing a critical role in enabling the “family portrait” images of solar siblings to be taken.  Image description 1: Planet Earth as a single, bright blue pixel in the vastness of space. Rays of sunlight scattered within the camera optics stretch across the scene, one of which happens to have intersected dramatically with Earth.

"All my favorite colors, right on.  Red, green, and blue aren’t the colors we usually associate with the Sun. In this composite picture, though, these hues unveil a secret: hidden light from the Sun.  This new view of solar light comes from our Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), our Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Hinode mission, with each type of data represented in a different color: blue for NuSTAR’s high-energy X-rays, red for SDO’s ultraviolet light, and green for Hinode’s lower energy X-rays.  Images like this could help us understand why the Sun’s outer atmosphere—the corona—is at least 100 times hotter than its surface. This phenomenon has puzzled scientists because the Sun’s heat originates in its core and travels outward, but’s observations could tell us more.  One potential source of the corona’s heat could be small eruptions in the Sun’s atmosphere called nanoflares. Nanoflares are outbursts of heat, light, and particles; they also happen more frequently than flares, possibly often enough to collectively heat the corona.

"How do you sleep so warm and fuzzy? (A scientific study)⁣ ⁣ Arctic ground squirrels are unique because they hibernate for eight to nine months of the year while slowing their metabolism so much that their body temperature can drop below freezing without suffering from the usual side effects like freezing, muscle loss, or loss of bone density during the long winter months. Studying our fuzzy friends can help researchers understand how the human body functions in a weightless environment.⁣ ⁣ This research, done by Dr. Kelly Drew of University of Alaska supported by @NASAArmstrong’s Space Grant, could be used to help future missions, from the extreme of medically induced hibernation for long term space missions, protecting astronauts from cabin fever, ionizing radiation and much more. It could also prove effective in preventing muscle and bone loss in zero gravity. These lessons could also have application in neurocritical care, which could mean that patients who have suffered from stroke or heart attack could be placed in medically induced hibernation (keeping the body temperature cooler) to slow their metabolism until they can be transported to a hospital to receive care, which could significantly improve medical outcomes.⁣ ⁣ Image description:⁣ A hibernating ground squirrel is held in glove-covered palms of a researcher.

"Jupiter ⁣💙 ⁣⁣ With an atmosphere of mostly hydrogen and helium, Jupiter – the fifth planet from the Sun – does not have a true surface but may have a core hidden deep within its atmospheric layers. Deep within the atmosphere, the pressure reduces the hydrogen gas to a liquid, giving the gas giant the largest ocean in our solar system. Our Juno spacecraft is helping us study the planet's composition; scientists believe that at depths around halfway to the planet's center, the pressure is so intense it squeezes electrons off hydrogen atoms, electrically conducting the gas like metal. ⁣ ⁣ Taken by Juno at an altitude of 11,747 miles (18,906 kilometers), this color-enhanced image shows the storms in Jupiter's northern hemisphere in detail.

"Putting a face to the name 🌝 ⁣ ⁣ Do you ever see faces in things? That's a phenomenon called pareidolia, and it's when our brains see familiar shapes in objects or data. We often do this when we look up at the sky and see faces or animals in the clouds. And sometimes in the cosmos. Here are some of our favorite examples of pareidolia in space⁣ ⁣ 1) A hill with a V-shaped collapse structure, two craters and a circular fracture pattern — possibly the remains of a buried impact crater — appear to form the face of a bear on the Mars surface. This image was captured by HiRISE aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on Dec. 12, 2022.⁣ ⁣ 2) NASA's Viking 1 Orbiter spacecraft photographed this region in the northern latitudes of Mars on July 25, 1976. The speckled appearance of the image is due to missing data, called bit errors, caused by problems in transmission of the photographic data from Mars to Earth. Bit errors comprise part of one of the 'eyes' and 'nostrils' on the eroded rock that resembles a human face near the center of the image. Shadows in the rock formation give the illusion of a nose and mouth. Planetary geologists attribute the origin of the formation to purely natural processes. ⁣ ⁣ 3) Take a look at this photo from Jan. 31. 2022, captured from the Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter (MRO). Harmakhis Vallis is an approximately 800-kilometer long outflow channel located in eastern Hellas. The valley probably formed by a combination of surface collapse and flowing water.

"Ring-a-ding-ding! 🪐  This image of Saturn was captured by the Cassini spacecraft while it orbited about 700,000  miles (1.1 million kilometers) from the planet in 2007.   The changing length of the shadow marks the passing of the seasons on Saturn. As the planet slowly neared its equinox which occurred in 2009, the ring-casted shadows slid further south. Saturn's equinoxes occur approximately every 15 Earth years, with the next one expected on May 6, 2025.   As Saturn approaches its equinox, the point in a planet's orbit where the Sun shines directly overhead at the equator, its rings become mainly illuminated by the sunlight which reflects off the planet’s surface. Hence, the section of the rings illuminated by planetshine are much brighter than the section of the rings illuminated by direct sunlight.   Image description: Saturn and its rings.

"The Moon is calling.	On Nov. 16, 2022, the Orion spacecraft launched aboard the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket from @NASAKennedy Space Center and embarked on the #Artemis I mission to the Moon and back. Orion orbited the Moon, getting as close as 79 miles (127 km) to the lunar surface, and successfully splashed back down to Earth 25.5 days later on Dec. 11.	Four RS-25 engines and two five-segment solid rocket boosters provided more than 8.8 million pounds (4 million kg) of thrust for SLS during liftoff and flight. Thanks in part to development of a new RS-25 engine controller that checks engine health 50 times per second, engineers were able to collect more than 100 measurements on pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds, and vibrations on the four RS-25 engines that helped power Artemis I. The preliminary post-flight data indicates that all SLS systems performed exceptionally and that the designs are ready to support a crewed flight on Artemis II.	The Artemis II mission will bring us closer to establishing a sustained human presence on the lunar surface and landing the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon.	This video was captured from the Launch Pad 39B perimeter and was used by engineers to monitor and track the rocket during flight.	Video credit: NASAMusic credit: Universal Production Music Cover photo: NASA/Chris Coleman and Kevin Dav	#MegaMoonRocket #Launch #SpaceLaunchSystem #LunarMission #STEM #NASA #Space #Liftoff #Rocket #NASAKennedy",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CoLINANJtMV/,post_805.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15SS9CbVz9FT3qXPl4eAF2HXEpAENDV10

"When a fire starts to burn... 🔥 SoFIE-GEL is the latest combustion experiment to be conducted aboard the @ISS. The experiment studies burning in microgravity by examining the characteristics of flame growth and extinction. Results could provide further insight into early fire growth behavior and help determine the best fire suppression techniques in future space facilities. Researchers could also use these results to safely select spacecraft cabin materials. Together all of this is working to keep future crews safe. SoFIE-GEL successfully conducted its first test aboard the space station on Jan. 13, 2023 using the space station’s Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR). Image description: This image shows a 4-cm diameter sphere of acrylic burning in microgravity.

"Texture Planet 🛰️The Red Planet offers a trove of textures in images captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), which launched in Aug. 2005. While previous cameras on other Mars orbiters could identify objects no smaller than a school bus, MRO’s @UAHiRISE camera can spot something as small as a kitchen table. Note, images are enhanced by researchers to show terrain and mineralogical detail. Swipe through these unique features:1. The northern plains of Arabia Terra have craters that contain curious deposits with mysterious shapes and distribution. It’s suspected that these features formed by sublimation of ice-rich material. The terraces might represent different periods of sublimation. Perhaps the larger craters penetrated to a water table between 45 and 60 meters below the surface and were flooded after formation. Image description: A turquoise colored surface has a crater on the left side outlined in a gold color.  Smaller craters dot the right side of the image, also detailed in gold.2. Small channels formed on the floor of the much larger Kasei Valles, one of the largest outflow channels on Mars. The enormous floods that formed such channels sometimes flowed around either side, forming islands with a streamlined shape. Image description: A cratered surface in black and white, while horizontal ripple formations twist and turn around the foreground.3. A dune field located along the western margin of Hellas Planitia, the floor of a giant depression in the Southern Hemisphere of Mars. Scientists take multiple pictures of the same dune fields to see if they can detect changes that indicate that the dunes are moving. Some Martian dune fields do shift and move under the present-day environmental conditions, but at a rate that is typically much slower than dunes move on Earth.

"Not your typical ice cube. 🧊  Although it is not uncommon to see icebergs with relatively straight edges, icebergs with two straight edges that converge into a right angle are less common. This rectangular iceberg was pictured in 2018 as part of Operation IceBridge, our longest-running aerial survey of polar ice. From 2009 to 2019, IceBridge flew planes loaded with special equipment over Earth’s polar regions to study sea ice, ice sheets, and glaciers to understand how Earth’s ice is changing.  The rectangular iceberg appeared to be freshly calved from Larsen C, a large ice shelf extending from the Antarctic Peninsula. In July 2017, Larsen C also released the massive A68 iceberg, a chunk of ice about the size of the state of Delaware. IceBridge data like this help @NASAEarth scientists better understand the effects of climate change on Earth’s polar regions.   Image description: A picture of sea ice extending to the horizon, taken from a low-flying aircraft. Where the ocean peeks through the ice is dark blue. Most of the ocean surface is covered in rough-looking white ice, thinner and thicker in some places, interspersed with sea ice icebergs. The icebergs have flat tops and sheer edges that rise above the sea ice. At this scope, perspective is hard to tell, but the icebergs rise far out of the water. In the center of the frame, an iceberg dominates. It is cut off to the left of the image, but the visible half looks almost perfectly rectangular, with smooth, straight edges and two precise right angles for corners.

"Astronomers: 🤩  The largest and brightest region of star formation in the Local Group of galaxies, which includes the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies, is called 30 Doradus (or Tarantula Nebula). Located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small neighbor galaxy to the Milky Way, 30 Doradus is often studied to help us understand how stars like the Sun are born and evolve.  One of the telescopes used to study this nearby region of space is @NASAChandraXray, whose X-ray data was combined with infrared imaging from @NASAWebb to create this composite image. Channeling the power of both telescopes, astronomers identified the remains of supernova explosions, which will release star-forming materials that will one day become part of the next generation of stars. Further, they detected a collection of infant-like “protostars,” taking their first breaths and igniting their stellar engines.   The fast rate of star formation in the Tarantula Nebula offers a glimpse of the conditions of the Milky Way several billion years ago. This, paired with its brightness and closeness, makes the Tarantula Nebula a favorite of astronomers hoping to learn more about star formation in our galaxy’s distant past.   Image description: A composite image of the Tarantula Nebula. Brightly colored and shimmering, the nebula has an oil-like sheen. X-ray data in royal blue and purple reveal superheated gases in the center and bottom of the image.

"Ignite the light, and let it shine! 🎆  This collection of stars that shimmer like a fireworks display were captured by @nasahubble in August and December 2009. The nebula, located 20,000 light-years away in the constellation Carina, contains a central cluster of huge, hot stars, and is surrounded by clouds of interstellar gas and dust - the raw material for new star formation. Its relative closeness to Earth makes it an excellent lab for studying such distant and momentous events.   Star clusters like this provide important clues to understanding the origin of massive star formation in the early, distant universe. Astronomers also use massive clusters to study distant starbursts that occur when galaxies collide, igniting a flurry of star formation.  Image description: A shimmering star cluster.

"Got a pocket, got a pocketful of starshine? ✨⁣ ⁣ One way to study what star formation was like in the early universe is to find parallels close by. That's why @NASAWebb took a look at NGC 346, finding never-before-seen pockets of star formation.⁣ ⁣ NGC 346 resides in our neighboring dwarf galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud. It has a composition much closer to that of galaxies from the early universe — when star formation was at its peak. By observing NGC 346, astronomers may learn what early star formation in far-off galaxies might have looked like.⁣ ⁣ Webb’s sensitivity allows it to see much smaller protostars (baby stars) than previously observed. The telescope can even see the dust in the disks of gas around those protostars, which is a first! Essentially, Webb is seeing the building blocks of not just stars, but also potentially planets. This could lead to learning if rocky planets formed earlier in the universe than we thought.⁣ ⁣ Read more at the link in @NASAWebb’s bio.⁣ ⁣ Image description: A star cluster within a nebula.

"""Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.” - Martin Luther King, Jr.  Supermoons, like this one which brightens the dark night sky high above the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, occur when the Moon’s orbit is at its closest point to Earth. This closest point in the Moon’s orbit is known as its perigee; in contrast, its farthest orbital point is known as its apogee.   This supermoon, which took place in 2016, was the closest the Moon has been to Earth since 1948, appearing 30 percent brighter and 14 percent bigger than the average monthly full moon. Although supermoons are not uncommon, with four supermoons to occur in 2023, the next time the Moon will appear in the night sky in a similarly record-breaking fashion won’t be until 2034.

"So, NGC 3293, tell me, how was your life as a youngster? ⭐  Astronomers are piecing together the chaotic nature of young stars. Using data from @nasachandraxray and ESA’s Gaia mission, scientists evaluated how boisterous X-ray emissions from young stars could damage or destroy the atmospheres of planets orbiting them.   Young star clusters, such as this one located about 8,300 light-years away in the Milky Way galaxy, may only be 11 million years old, but could pose a threat to planetary atmospheres in their own solar systems. Unruly magnetically active young stars disrupt the formation processes of planets in the disk of gas and dust that surround them by quickly clearing away their disks—halting the growth of planets.  This activity also affects the habitability of the planets that emerge after the disk has disappeared. If a star is extremely active, then scientists predict it will blast planets in its system with a high-energy barrage of X-rays and ultraviolet light that could cause a planet to lose much of its original, hydrogen-rich atmosphere within a few million years. It might also strip away a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere that forms later, unless it is protected by a magnetic field—like our own that prevented such an outcome for Earth.  Image description: A distant star cluster resembles a cone of bright stars and wispy, rose-colored clouds, set against a starry sky.

"The cold never bothered me anyway 🧊⁣ ⁣ Our Cassini spacecraft glimpsed Saturn's cold and icy moon Enceladus, whose frozen surface ice hides a deep ocean. Though it may look like rivers etch the surface of the small moon, the cracks covering the surface are believed to be from relatively warm sections in the crust, where ice water particles and gasses jet out continuously from the oceans below, contributing to Saturn's E ring. Some of these fissures may be hydrothermal vents that stretch down to its ocean.⁣ ⁣ Enceladus is a small moon that orbits Saturn at a distance of 148,000 miles (238,000 km) in a tidally locked elliptical pattern – the same side of Enceladus faces toward the planet, with an average temperature of -330 Fº (-201 Cº). The average thickness of the icy shell is about 12 to 16 miles (20 to 25 km).⁣ ⁣ In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft first examined the moon's south polar region, capturing its unique and complex terrain. Along the way, the spacecraft has deepened our understanding of the moon – leading scientists to believe that Enceladus' chemistry, vast oceans, and internal heat – make it a prime world to search for life beyond our planet.⁣ ⁣ Image description: Cassini's image of the white surface of Enceladus is seen in an enhanced colored view.

"Here’s to Earth’s best buddy. 🥂   The Moon, Earth’s loyal celestial neighbor, is believed to have formed about 4.5 billion years ago after a Mars-sized object collided with Earth—the debris from this collision solidified into what we now know as the Moon.  Despite its tumultuous beginning, our relationship with the Moon is a beneficial one. The Moon's gravity moderates our planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. The Moon also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years.  Looking to the future, the lunar surface will provide shelter for a long-term presence in space. The Moon’s South Pole contains frozen water which may be used to create drinking water, breathable air, and even fuel.

"Ring in the new year! 🪐   We’re celebrating like it’s 1999—the year that @NASAHubble captured this image of Saturn, the sixth planet from our Sun.   Hubble took several photos of Saturn between 1996 and 2000, observing how its rings appear differently from our perspective as the gas giant makes its 29-year-long journey around the Sun. For instance, when Saturn’s rings are viewed from their edge on, they seem to be small and thin. However, when the planet’s orbit has moved enough that they can be viewed from an angle, the full picturesque breadth of Saturn’s iconic rings can be seen.    The particles that make up Saturn’s rings mostly range from tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house, with a few particles as large as mountains. Saturn's rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids, or shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet, torn apart by its powerful gravity. One of the most impressive sights in our solar system, Saturn continues to allure astronomers, with recent @NASAWebb observations targeting its largest moon Titan. Saturn has also been visited by four robotic missions—including our Cassini spacecraft, which dove into the planet's atmosphere in 2017.   Image Description: Saturn and its rings. The warm brown-and-creme hues of Saturn’s cloudy atmosphere present a gradient of color against the dark blackness of space. At its south pole, the darkest shades of the ombré pattern create a circle of earthy brown. Circling Saturn, grey rings are intersected by the Cassini Division, a gap measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers), which breaks up the otherwise halo-like rings.

Cosmically middle-aged and classified as a yellow dwarf, the Sun's dynamic and ever-changing nature constantly sends energy into the solar system. Scientists can estimate the age of the Sun by looking at the most ancient things in our solar system, which along with the Sun, all formed around the same time. ⁣ The Sun is at the center of our solar system, 865,000 miles wide (1.4 million km) with a core that reaches temperatures of 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius). Our Sun’s gravity holds our solar system together, from the largest planets to the smallest space debris. ⁣ ⁣ A fleet of spacecraft monitors the Sun 24/7, broadening our knowledge of the star in a branch of science known as heliophysics – including the spacecraft that took this image: the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). ⁣ ⁣ The SDO orbits Earth in a geosynchronous pattern – it maintains a figure-eight path over the longitude of New Mexico. Because of its orbit, it is constantly in view of radio antennas on Earth; it also enters an eclipse season twice a year when the spacecraft slips behind Earth for up to 72 minutes a day, obscuring the Sun with Earth’s shadow as seen here.⁣ ⁣ Image description: Black space surrounds the Sun, which glows and swirls in red, orange, and spots of yellow and is shrouded by the shadow of Earth.

"A rose by any other name. 🌹  Although this star-studded image may first resemble a skull, it is little more than a trick of the eye. Actually, this @nasachandraxray composite image shows a portion of the Rosette Nebula, named for its rose-shaped arrangement, which lies about 5,000 light-years from Earth.   Data from Chandra reveals hundreds of young stars clustered in the center of the image and additional fainter clusters on either side. Observations from the Digitized Sky Survey and the @KittPeakObservatory reveal the stars lurking inside this delicate cosmic rosebud. These super-hot stars, called O-stars, have blown layers of dust and gas away with their powerful radiation and winds, revealing a cavity of cooler dust. Some of Rosette's O-stars can be seen in the bubble-like cavity; however, the largest two stars in this picture are not in the nebula itself.  Recent Chandra observations have revealed that the darker region of Rosette is a nursery for newly formed stars. Within the dense molecular cloud which makes up the “jaw” of this skull-like arrangement, hundreds of newly born stars are swaddled beneath a gaseous veil.

"Shine bright, shine far, be a star.  These bright blue swirls are the spiral galaxy NGC 6956, located 214 million light-years away in the constellation Delphinus. Scientists used our @nasahubble Space Telescope to image and study the galaxy’s Cepheid variable stars, which are stars that brighten and dim at regular periods.  Scientists can measure how bright these stars appear from Earth and compare it to their actual brightness to calculate their distance. As a result, these stars are extremely useful in determining the distance of cosmic objects, which is one of the hardest pieces of information to measure for extragalactic objects.  NGC 6956 also contains a Type Ia (read ""type one-A"") supernova. Like Cepheid variable stars, we can determine the distance of these types of supernovae by studying their brightness and how fast they dim over time; these measurements help us refine our understanding of the rate of expansion of the universe, also known as the Hubble Constant.

"Our intergalactic neighbor’s light display. 🕯   This image from our @nasahubble Space Telescope captures a small portion of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of the Milky Way’s nearest neighbors, lying only about 200,000 light-years from Earth. It makes a pair with the Large Magellanic Cloud, and both objects are best seen from the Southern Hemisphere, but are visible from some northern latitudes as well.   The Small Magellanic Cloud contains hundreds of millions of stars, but this image focuses on just a small fraction of them. These stars comprise the open cluster NGC 376, which has a total mass only about 3,400 times that of the Sun. Open clusters, as the name suggests, are loosely bound and sparsely populated. This distinguishes open clusters from globular clusters, which generally appear as a continuous blur of starlight at their centers because they are so crammed with stars. In the case of NGC 376, individual stars are clearly discernable even in the most densely populated parts of this image.   The data in this image come from two different astronomical investigations which relied on two of Hubble’s instruments: the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The first investigation used the ACS to explore a handful of star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud and helped astronomers explore topics including the abundance of low- and high-mass stars in different environments. The second investigation used both the WFC3 and ACS, and aimed to answer fundamental questions about the lives of stars and help astronomers understand precisely where, when, why, and how stars form.

"After four years on the Red Planet, InSight is signing off. 🤖  Our InSight mission, which has been collecting unique scientific data on Mars, has come to an end. After two consecutive attempts, the mission team at @nasajpl was unable to contact the lander, a sign that the spacecraft’s solar-powered batteries have run out.   InSight (short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) set out to study the deep interior of Mars in 2018 and achieved its primary science goals in its first Mars year (nearly two Earth years). Since arriving on the Red Planet, InSight has left a legacy worthy of its name, gathering a rich bounty of scientific data.   The mission made scientific discoveries on a seismic scale, its instruments revealing details about Mars’ crust, mantle, and core, helping scientists better understand how all rocky worlds form, including Earth and its Moon. Over its four-year stint at Elysium Planitia, a flat smooth plain that served as its landing site and home, InSight collected new data on the weather on this region of Mars. The mission also took the first seismographic readings beyond Earth since the Apollo missions, measuring a total of 1,319 marsquakes—including ones caused by meteroid impacts.   Ever insightful, the lander continued taking readings using its seismometer, the last of its science instruments that remained active even as dust on the lander’s solar panels gradually reduced its energy levels. As InSight takes its final bow on Mars, we thank the mission teams around the world for all the incredible discoveries and data it has provided—data that scientists will use for years to come.

"Simple ingredients in a simple way. 👩‍🍳⁣ ⁣ Our @NASAWebb telescope has observed the ingredients that may lead to habitable planets, trapped in ice. This ice was found about 630 light-years from Earth in a dark, cold molecular cloud called Chamaeleon I. (Molecular clouds are clouds where stars and planets can be born.) There isn’t just water ice; scientists found evidence of frozen ingredients ranging from simple molecules like carbonyl sulfide, ammonia, and methane to those more complex than methanol.⁣ ⁣ By imaging Chamaeleon I in specific infrared wavelengths, Webb scientists examined how starlight from beyond the molecular cloud was absorbed by the icy molecules, leaving “chemical fingerprints.” These “fingerprints” were then studied against lab data here on Earth. The findings suggest that newly formed planetary systems in this molecular cloud receive complex molecules that could be the precursor to life through star formation.⁣ ⁣ Image Description: A Webb image of the central region of the Chamaeleon I dark molecular cloud, which resides 630 light-years away. This image primarily shows blue smoky wisps on a dark background. The left top side additionally features orange and white wisps. Just below them are four bright points of light. Three are orange and one is a mix of white and orange. Each of these points have Webb’s signature 8-point diffraction spikes emanating around them in long, thick orange lines, so that they look like huge snowflakes. Scattered throughout the image are distant stars or galaxies in shades of red, orange and blue, seen as tiny blobs.⁣ ⁣ Credits: NASA, ESA, CSA, and M. Zamani (@EuropeanSpaceAgency); Science: F.

"You can get with this, or you can get with that. 🔵🔴  While these two images may look dazzlingly different, they are actually pictures of the same cosmic object located 160,000 light-years away. Although @NASAHubble took both images, different filters were used to study different wavelengths of light emanating from these objects. The blue image highlights near-infrared light along with visible light, whereas the red image covers a range of near-ultraviolet to the beginnings of the infrared spectrum.   This 100 million-year-old globular cluster is located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Typical of globular clusters, it is a spherical collection of densely packed stars held together by mutual gravitational attraction. Unlike most globular clusters, these stars are relatively young.   Astrophysicists theorize that when the first generation of these stars was born, they ejected matter. The density of the new star cluster was so high that this matter could not escape the cluster’s gravitational pull, causing it to stay nearby and form a second generation of stars, increasing the density of this globular cluster. By using Hubble data to study clusters like this, astronomers are able to better understand star formation.   Image Description 1: Hubble observation using blue filters.

"Out of the blue ☁️⁣ ⁣ An open star cluster northwest part of the Large Magellanic cloud, a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way, shows an abundance of star-forming regions. Open clusters are a type of star cluster with loose gravitational attraction between the stars, which causes the cluster to be more spread out and unusually shaped.⁣ ⁣ In addition to its funky shape, this is an emission nebula, which is a cloud of interstellar gas that has been ionized by ultraviolet wavelengths radiating off nearby stars. The gas of the nebula emits its own light at visible wavelengths (as our eyes would see it), seen here as a faint cloud that populates the middle and bottom right of the image.⁣ ⁣ The cluster is estimated to be around 10 million years old, but contains stars at different phases of their evolution, making it a complex collection.

To differentiate between the data from the two telescopes, Chandra data is represented by higher-frequency tones while the Swift data is lower. In addition to the X-rays, the image includes optical data from the Digitized Sky Survey that shows background stars. Each star in optical light triggers a musical note.

Opportunity made a number of discoveries about Mars, including dramatic evidence that long ago at least one area of the planet stayed wet for an extended period, and that conditions could have been suitable for sustaining microbial life.  After 5111 Sols (Martian days) and venturing 26.219 miles (42.195 kilometers), the Opportunity rover sent its final communication home to Earth, its solar panels disrupted by a severe Mars-wide dust storm. After more than a thousand commands to restore contact, engineers in Mission Control made their last attempt to revive Opportunity on Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2019.  Oppy’s legacy lives on. Curiosity and Perseverance, the next generation of Mars rovers, continue their journey of scientific exploration across the Red Planet. The discoveries made by Opportunity pave the wave for future missions to return Martian samples to Earth for further analysis and investigation for evidence of life.  Image Description: A self-portrait of NASA's Opportunity Mars rover shows the rover in tones of gray; its solar array and “head” standing out against the lighter grays of the Martian sky. This was taken with the rover's Microscopic Imager to celebrate the 5000th Martian Day, or sol, of the rover's mission. The Microscopic Imager is a fixed-focus camera mounted at the end of the rover's robotic arm. Because it was designed for close inspection of rocks, soils and other targets at a distance of around 2.7 inches (7 cm), the rover is out of focus. The rover's self-portrait view is made by stitching together multiple images. Wrist motions and turret rotations on the arm allowed the Microscopic Imager to acquire the mosaic's component images. The resulting mosaic does not include the rover's arm.

"Snoopy has a proud history of floating, and not just down the streets of New York City.  For more than 50 years, @Snoopygrams has contributed to the excitement for NASA human spaceflight missions, helping inspire generations to dream big.  In 1969, Apollo 10 astronauts traveled to the Moon for one final test before the lunar landing attempt. The mission required the lunar module to skim the lunar surface to within 50,000 feet and ""snoop around"" scouting the Apollo 11 landing site, leading the crew to name the lunar module ""Snoopy."" The Apollo command module, in turn, was labeled ""Charlie Brown.”  Today, #AstronautSnoopy is orbiting the Moon with @NASAArtemis. Inside the Orion spacecraft, he plays a special role as Orion’s zero-gravity indicator, providing a visual when the spacecraft has reached the near weightlessness of microgravity. The character balloon also floated through Manhattan as part of the 2022 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.  Image Descriptions: 1. A large inflatable Snoopy float drifts down the streets of New York City in a parade. Snoopy, a caricature of a white dog with black eyes and a black snout, is dressed in the bright orange flight suit and visor helmet donned by NASA astronauts.  2.

"Next Stop: the Moon⁣ ⁣ #Artemis I Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion spacecraft arrive at Launch Pad 39B at @NASAKennedy ahead of its Wednesday, Nov. 16, launch attempt. ⁣ ⁣ Artemis I’s primary goal is to thoroughly test the integrated systems in preparation for crewed missions. Launching Orion on top of the SLS rocket, operating the spacecraft in a deep space environment and testing Orion’s heat shield, and recovering the crew module after reentry, descent and splashdown, are all crucial events that help inform us for future missions with @NASAAstronauts. During this flight, Orion will launch atop the most powerful rocket in the world, and will fly farther than any human-related spacecraft has ever flown, paving the way for human deep space exploration – eventually extending human presence to the Moon and beyond. ⁣ ⁣ The English-language live broadcast of the launch begins on Tuesday, Nov. 15 at 10:30 pm ET (330 am UTC).

"Gotta get back, back to the past   Thanks to @nasawebb’s Near-Infrared Camera, we have a brand-new view of the dwarf galaxy Wolf–Lundmark–Melotte (WLM). This image demonstrates Webb’s remarkable ability to resolve faint stars outside the Milky Way.   WLM is close to the Milky Way—about 3-million light-years away from Earth—but also relatively isolated. Scientists believe WLM hasn’t interacted with other systems, so it’s great for testing out theories of how stars form and evolve in small galaxies. Other nearby galaxies are intertwined and entangled with the Milky Way, which makes them harder to study.   Also, the gas in WLM is similar to the gas that made up galaxies in the early universe: it’s poor in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Researchers want to reconstruct the way stars were formed by studying the dwarf galaxy. Low-mass stars can live for billions of years, which means that some of the stars that we see in WLM today formed in the early universe. Learning the properties of these stars will give us insight into what was happening in the very distant past.   Image description: Dwarf galaxy Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte as viewed by the Webb telescope’s NIRCam instrument. Countless white stars, interspersed with yellow and orange background galaxies of various shapes, dot the black background.

"Good things come in threes.  As our Juno spacecraft completed its 38th close flyby of Jupiter on November 29, 2021, it captured the swirling storms of the gas giant and two of its largest moons – Callisto and Io.  Seen faintly at the bottom of the image, Callisto is the second-largest moon in the Jovian system and third largest in our solar system. Callisto has a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide, and scientists believe its ice-crusted surface may hide a salty ocean.  Only slightly larger than Earth's moon, Jupiter's moon Io is the most volcanically active planetary body in the solar system. Caught between the massive gravitational pull of Jupiter and two of its neighboring moons, Europa and Ganymede, Io is tidally locked – meaning the same side of Io always faces the planet.  Now in its extended mission, the spacecraft will continue to study Jupiter and its moons in greater detail, learning about the Jovian system's magnetic fields, atmosphere, and magnetosphere.   Image description: At the top of the photo, a portion of Jupiter is seen in a swirling mass of blue, tan, and green. In the center-right of the picture, the Moon Io is small, gray, and dimly lit.

"The last rays of an orbital sunset @Astro_FrankRubio is pictured during a Nov. 15, 2022, spacewalk outside @ISS. Rubio and fellow NASA astronaut Josh Cassada spent seven hours and 11 minutes working on the orbiting lab, to prepare for an upgrade to the station's solar arrays. They assembled a mounting bracket on the starboard truss structure where new International Space Station Rollout Solar Arrays (iROSAs) will be installed on upcoming spacewalks. These solar panels, which roll out like a rug or a yoga mat using stored kinetic energy, expand the energy-production capabilities of the space station.This was the first spacewalk for both Rubio and Cassada, and the 254th spacewalk in support of space station assembly, upgrades and maintenance. The next two U.S. spacewalks to install iROSAs are scheduled on Tuesday, Nov. 29, and Saturday, Dec. 3. Image Description: An astronaut wearing a spacesuit with reflective visor down and USA flag patch on the right sleeve is pictured outside the International Space Station, with a tether connecting the astronaut to the station's starboard truss structure on the right side of the frame.

"Making an impact. ☄️  Last December, a meteoroid crashed into the surface of Mars, creating a crater roughly 490 feet (150 meters) wide—and sending shockwaves across the Red Planet. NASA's InSight lander ""heard"" the impact, which generated a magnitude 4 marsquake, and coordinated with our Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to capture photos of the crash's aftermath.   Not only is this one of the largest craters ever observed forming in real time, its creation sprayed boulder-sized blocks of frozen water around the impact site, visible as white dots and streaks in this photo. Though we've known that ice lurks below the surface of Mars, this is the closest we've ever seen buried ice near the Martian equator. Water is both essential for human life and a key ingredient for resources like rocket fuel, making this a great discovery for future human missions to Mars.

Artemis I is uncrewed, but it lays the groundwork for increasingly complex missions that will land humans on the lunar surface, including the first woman and the first person of color to do so.⁣ ⁣ With Artemis, we will build a long-term human presence on the Moon, and prepare humanity for future exploration plans to Mars and beyond.⁣ ⁣ Over the course of the Artemis I mission, the Orion spacecraft will travel 280,000 miles (450,000 kilometers) from Earth and 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) beyond the far side of the Moon. Orion will stay in space longer than any human spacecraft has without docking to a space station and return home faster and hotter than ever before.⁣ ⁣ After almost 26 days in space, Orion will splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on Dec. 11, 2022.⁣ ⁣ Image descriptions:⁣ ⁣ 1.

"Total lunar eclipse of the heart ❤️⁣ ⁣ On Tuesday, November 8, between 3:02 and 6:42 a.m. EST (0802-1350 UTC), a total lunar eclipse will occur, the last total lunar eclipse until March 14, 2025.⁣ ⁣ A lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align, allowing the Moon to pass into Earth's shadow. In a total lunar eclipse, the entire Moon falls within the umbra – the darkest part of Earth's shadow.⁣ ⁣ During a lunar eclipse, light passes through our atmosphere before reaching the lunar surface, allowing colors of longer wavelengths, such as red and orange, to lightly illuminate its surface, while colors like blue and violet scatter across our planet.⁣ ⁣ Image description:⁣ ⁣ A composite photo shows the Moon in different stages of the eclipse from top left to bottom right.

"Countdown to a new star ⏳   Hidden in the neck of this “hourglass” of light are the very beginnings of a new star — a protostar. The clouds of dust and gas within this region are only visible in infrared light, the wavelengths that the James Webb Space Telescope specializes in.   This protostar is a hot, puffy clump of gas that’s only a fraction of the mass of our Sun. As it draws material in, its core will compress, get hotter, and eventually begin nuclear fusion — creating a star!   See that dark line at the very center of the “hourglass”? That’s an edge-on view of a protoplanetary disk, or the disk of material being pulled into the star as it forms. It’s about the size of our solar system and may eventually clump into planets, giving us a window into our solar system’s history.   Light from the protostar is illuminating cavities in the dust and gas above and below its disk. (Think of flashlights pointing in opposite directions, each shining a cone of light.) The blue areas are where dust is thinnest, while orange represents thicker layers of dust. Learn more at the link in our @NASAWebb bio!

"Curiosity: I like digging holes. Us: Then you're in the right place.  After a summer road trip through the sandy Paraitepuy Pass, pictured above, our Curiosity Mars Rover has arrived at the “sulfate-bearing unit,” a region of Mount Sharp enriched with salty minerals.   Scientists have wanted to see this region up close for over 10 years before Curiosity landed! They hypothesize that billions of years ago, streams and ponds left behind the minerals as the water dried up. Assuming the hypothesis is correct, these minerals offer tantalizing clues as to how – and why – the Red Planet’s climate changed from being more Earth-like to the frozen desert it is today.  Soon after arriving, the rover discovered a diverse array of rock types and signs of past water, including nodules and minerals such as magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt is one kind), calcium sulfate (including gypsum), and sodium chloride (ordinary table salt). For the mission’s 36th drill sample, Curiosity gathered a sample from a rock nicknamed “Canaima.” The mission’s scientists look forward to analyzing portions of the sample with the Chemical and Minerology instrument and the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument.  By the way, this is just one part of the panorama. To see the whole image, visit @nasajpl.

"Do you know what today is? 🎵   25 years ago, the Cassini spacecraft and Huygens lander probe launched, beginning the mission to study Saturn and its moons. The voyage to the planet took seven years, requiring four gravity assist maneuvers (a gravity assist is a technique that uses a planet to accelerate a spacecraft). Cassini-Huygens, a joint project between NASA, @europeanspaceagency, @agenziaspazialeitaliana, and @nasajpl, entered an elliptical orbit around Saturn on July 1, 2004; it was the first spacecraft to do so.   Cassini’s 13-year-long investigation of the Saturn system—initially planned to be four years long, but extended twice—allowed us to observe Saturn for nearly half of its 30-year orbit around the Sun, seeing hexagonal cloud patterns around Saturn’s north pole and a long-lived storm that circled the planet’s northern hemisphere. Cassini also made extraordinary discoveries on Saturn’s moons, like ice volcanoes on Enceladus and hydrocarbon lakes on Titan.   Though Cassini ended its exploration of Saturn on Sept. 15, 2017, after 20 years in space, the science gained through its efforts lives on. We continue to study the data Cassini-Huygens provided us, and lessons learned during the mission are being applied in planning our Europa Clipper mission.

Both Voyagers are in interstellar space now.⁣ ⁣⁣ As Voyager approached Jupiter, the two spacecraft took more than 33,000 pictures of the gas giant and its four major satellites, leading astronomers to discover volcanoes on Io and that the Great Red Spot is a complex storm. Their next stop was Saturn, which they visited nine months apart, studying the planet's atmospheric composition, wind speeds, and temperature. ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Voyager 2 continued its tour of the gas giants, studying Uranus’ geological features and detecting 11 previously unseen moons and two rings.

"So you want to slow down a spacecraft? Well, you’ve got two options–but coming soon, you might have a third. ☄  There are currently two methods for slowing down a spacecraft when landing; which option to choose (or if you use them together) depends primarily on how much atmosphere your landing site has.  The first option, retropropulsion, is best used when there is little to no atmosphere to help slow down a spacecraft. Retropropulsion is where you use thrusters pointed down at the surface of the planet to slow yourself down as you're coming in—like those used by the Apollo missions.  The second option, heat shields, is used if you do have an atmosphere, which makes slowing down much easier, as the atmosphere acts as a giant brake as you slow down. In this scenario, a heat-resistant shield is on the blunt end of your spacecraft as it travels through the atmosphere. Finally, once the heat shield has sufficiently slowed the spacecraft, parachutes are deployed to slow it down the rest of the way for a safe landing.  However, teams are working on a brand-new third method called Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD). Much like a traditional heat shield, HIAD can deploy to slow a spacecraft through the atmosphere, but unlike a traditional heat shield, it is fabricated out of a highly compactable flexible woven system instead of the bulky ceramics or metals of past missions. The result: improved heat shield results at a fraction of the space and weight.   Set to launch Nov. 1, 2022, with @NOAA’s #JPSS2 mission, LOFTID will demonstrate this new heat shield's ability to slow down and survive atmospheric entry.

"Even galaxies have that one friend. 🌌  Although they appear serene and unperturbed, these two galaxies are subtly warping one another through a mutual gravitational interaction that is disrupting and distorting both. I mean... we’ve all got that one friend we can be our true wacky selves with, right? Tag them in the comments.  These two interacting galaxies seem to float side by side in this image captured by @NASAHubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys. The galactic duo is part of an effort to build up an archive of interesting targets for more detailed future study by the combined might of Hubble, ground-based telescopes, and @NASAWebb. To build up this archive, astronomers scoured existing astronomical catalogs for a list of targets spread throughout the night sky.  Deciding how to award Hubble observing time is a drawn-out, competitive, and difficult process, and the observations are allocated to use every last second of the telescope's time available. However, there is a small but persistent fraction of time available as Hubble turns to point at new targets. Snapshot programs exist to fill this gap and take advantage of the moments between longer observations. Snapshot programs not only produce beautiful images, they enable astronomers to make the most out of the valuable limited time available for telescope observations.

"Regulators, mount up! 🌟  A new study has revealed a star cluster that can regulate itself, allowing only a limited number of stars to grow before the biggest and brightest among them expel most of the gas from the system. This process is thought to restrict new star creation.  Astronomers used data from @NASAChandraXRay, NASA’s airborne @sofiatelescope, the APEX telescope, and ESA’s Herschel space observatory to study a distant star-forming complex located in the Milky Way about 2,900 light-years from Earth. These types of star-forming areas are made up of large gas clouds that are rich in the stellar components needed to form new stars.  By analyzing data from this comprehensive array of telescopes, astronomers are able to witness that the powerful stars near the center of the cluster are expelling most of the raw materials within the star-forming region at high rates, on a course to deplete star-forming resources in about one to two million years. Although millions of years seem like a long time from the perspective of humans, relative to the lifespan of stars it is quite quick.   This high-speed rate of resource consumption will ultimately slow new star development in the region in a process astronomers call “stellar feedback.” This process will clear out the raw material needed to form stars, drastically suppressing their continued birth in the region, which would better align with astronomers’ predictions for how quickly stars form in clusters.

"Hurricane Ian hit the southwestern coast of Florida on Sept. 28, 2022, bringing sustained winds of about 150 miles (240 kilometers) per hour as well as a rise in sea level, relentless downpours, and flooding. The storm redistributed water, stirring up colorful sediment off Florida's coasts, which can be seen in this natural-color satellite image acquired days after the hurricane by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on our Terra satellite. Swipe to see what the water looked like before Hurricane Ian's approach.  The turquoise color is likely sediment that Ian lifted from the seafloor as it neared the coast. Brown water closer to shore is likely colored by sediment from land, carried by rivers and runoff flowing into the ocean.  Prior to the storm, there was already some color in the water, but much of that is due to light reflecting off sea grass beds, the sandy seafloor, and coral reefs.  Image descriptions:  Image 1: An aerial view of Florida on Oct. 1, 2022, showing land, the surrounding water, and clouds. The clouds above are concentrated in several spots, especially around the southernmost part of the state and east over the water. Most noticeably, the water has large patches of turquoise, suggesting disturbed sediment.  Image 2: The same view of Florida, on Sept. 22, 2022. The clouds are scattered and relatively sparse, while the water is mostly a deep, dark blue, with some pockets of turquoise at the southernmost edge of Florida and further southeast.

"So nice, we captured it twice 🔭⁣ ⁣ @NASAWebb’s first infrared images are brought to new light with the addition of X-ray data from @NASAChandraXray.⁣ ⁣ Cartwheel Galaxy: The Cartwheel Galaxy got its shape from a collision with a smaller galaxy (outside the field) about 100 million years ago. X-rays seen by Chandra (blue and purple) come from superheated gas, exploded stars, and neutron stars and black holes pulling material from companion stars. Webb’s infrared view (red, orange, yellow, green, blue) shows the Cartwheel Galaxy plus 2 smaller companions (not part of the collision) against a backdrop of many more distant galaxies.⁣ ⁣ Stephan's Quintet: 4 galaxies in Stephan’s Quintet are undergoing an intricate gravitational dance. (The 5th galaxy on the left is at a different distance!) Webb’s image (red, orange, yellow, green, blue) features never-seen-before details, like sweeping tails of gas and star formation bursts. Chandra (light blue) uncovers a shock wave that heats gas to tens of millions of degrees, as one galaxy passes through the others at around 2 million miles per hour. This image also includes infrared data from Spitzer (red, green, blue), now retired.⁣ ⁣ Deep Field: Webb shows how a galaxy cluster, located ~4.2 billion light-years away, contains hundreds of galaxies. Galaxy clusters are filled with vast reservoirs of superheated gas seen only in X-ray light. Chandra data (blue) reveals gas with temperatures of tens of millions of degrees, possessing a total mass about 100 trillion times that of the Sun. Invisible dark matter forms an even larger fraction of the cluster’s total mass.⁣ ⁣ Carina Nebula: Chandra’s data (pink) reveals over a dozen X-ray sources. These are mostly 1-2 million year old stars (very young for stars!) located in the outer region of a star cluster in the Carina Nebula. Young stars are much brighter in X-rays than old stars. The X-ray emission in the image’s top half likely comes from hot gas from the nebula’s 3 hottest, most massive stars, outside Webb’s view.

"⁣Cosmic tree rings! 😮  ⠀ Just as growth rings record the history of a tree, these rings contain more than a century’s worth of stellar history. Every eight years, the two stars in this image are brought together by their orbits — creating colliding streams of gas that, with the right conditions, form a new ring of dust. The James Webb Space Telescope reveals 15 of the 17 rings seen here for the first time! ⠀ This star pair, known together as Wolf-Rayet 140 (WR 140), contains one Wolf-Rayet star. Wolf-Rayet stars are rare — only 600 have been found. They’re incredibly short-lived, generating powerful winds that push huge amounts of gas into space. Scientists believe that the Wolf-Rayet star in this pair may have already shed half its original mass in this process! ⠀ Some other Wolf-Rayet systems also form dust, but only WR 140 is known to make rings. The ring pattern comes from WR 140’s Wolf-Rayet star, which has a unique elongated orbit.⠀ ⠀ Webb observed WR 140 with its mid-infrared instrument (MIRI), which is designed to see cooler objects such as these spectacular dust rings. MIRI also shows the best evidence yet that Wolf-Rayet stars can produce carbon-rich dust molecules, and that such molecules can survive even in the hostile environment surrounding these stars.⠀  ⠀ Bringing it closer to home, this helps us understand how Wolf-Rayet stars potentially supply materials for star and planet formation — and may even have played a role in creating our own solar system.

"All the drama—without the daytime TV. 📺  These cosmic clouds, called Herbig-Haro objects, are a telltale sign of a newly formed star. Formed when young stars expel jets of gas at incredibly high speeds, these superheated jets speed through space colliding with cooler surrounding materials. The result: these colorful cosmic wisps pictured by @NASAHubble.   With Herbig-Haro objects, there is more than meets the eye. These cosmic objects help astronomers understand the turbulent interactions within stellar nurseries—and can help us pinpoint the location of stars invisible to the human eye.    For instance, astronomers once thought that the bright star to the right of the image was the source of these jets. In actuality, the young star system responsible for their creation is lurking out of sight, swaddled in the thick clouds of dust at the center of this image. But by using @NASAWebb, which observes at predominantly infrared wavelengths, we will be able to peer into the dusty envelopes surrounding still-forming infant stars such as this, revolutionizing the study of these young stars.

"I like your flare. ☀  The Sun isn’t idle in the sky. Our nearby star is a dynamic object, constantly changing and creating space weather events, such as this solar flare captured by @nasasolarsystem’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) on Oct. 2, 2022.   Solar flares are intense bursts of radiation coming from the release of magnetic energy on the Sun’s surface. In this image, they are noticeable as the brightest areas of the Sun and can last from minutes to hours.    In addition to monitoring the Sun’s activity, we also categorize and classify it. This most recent flare is classified as an X1 flare. An X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number, which reaches a maximum of nine, provides more information about its strength.   Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth’s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, however—when intense enough—they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS & communications signals travel. By studying flares and how they affect our planet and nearby space, the SDO helps us to better prepare for and mitigate these potential disruptions.

"Did someone say weekend? 🤩  Over 9,000 light-years away, in the constellation Taurus, a shroud of thick gas and dust surrounds a bright young star—the remnants of a cosmic explosion. @NASAHubble investigated this distant explosive event to help astronomers understand the early stages in the lives of massive stars.   Unlike the cosmic materials which typically surround young stars in twin outflows of gas and dust, the materials of this star are expelled in a tumultuous fan-like spray at velocities of up to 217 miles per second (350 kilometers per second).   To measure how far away this star truly is astronomers had to use context clues to reveal the complete answer. While it is possible to measure the velocity of material speeding outward from the star, astronomers cannot tell how far from Earth the star actually is from a single observation. Therefore, they measured how far the outflow travels between successive images and from there inferred the star's distance from our home planet. Knowing the distance of a star allows astronomers to determine how bright the star is and how much energy it emits, and therefore estimate its mass—vital information in determining the origins of this bright young star's unique physique.   Image Description: Remnants of a star’s cosmic explosion. At the focal point of this image is a cloud of swirly debris comprising stellar materials of gas and dust spreading outwards from the center of the image. The debris is hues of orange and brown becoming increasingly wispy further from its epicenter, among the furthest reaches the debris appears lighter shades of grey and blue. The background of the image is the deep black of space interrupted by speckles of stars throughout.   Image Credit: ESA/Hubble & NASA, R.

"Space Spiral 🌀  Located about 80 million light-years away in the constellation Camelopardalis, this galaxy pictured by @NASAHubble unfurls its gorgeous spiral arms in a cosmic display.  The galaxy is characterized as both an intermediate spiral and an active galactic nuclei. As an intermediate spiral, the galaxy is neither “barred” nor “unbarred,"" meaning it doesn’t have a well-defined “bar” of stars at its galactic center, nor are its spirals tightly bound. Additionally, as an active galactic nuclei, this galaxy has a notably bright center that far outshines the rest of the galaxy at certain wavelengths of light. This likely means that the galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its core which churns out bright jets and winds that helps to shape its iconic spiraling shape.  Although eye-catching, on a cosmic level this galaxy is a fairly common type of active galactic nuclei.  There are several methods in use for classifying galaxies according to their morphologies, or forms, the most famous of which is the Hubble sequence, devised by Edwin Hubble, the namesake of the Hubble Space Telescope. Although his sequence was expanded upon by later astronomers, much of modern galaxy classification is done via computations instead.  Image Description: The galaxy NGC 1961 is pictured by the Hubble Space Telescope. A massive swirling galaxy dominates the image. In the center of the image, the galactic core is visible shining brightly white. The inner swirls of the galaxy are wisps of blue and stellar dust. Towards the outskirts of the galaxy, glittering blue regions of bright young stars dot the dusty spiral arms. In the corners of the image, the blackness of space permeates the image with small colorful dots of distant galaxies visible.  Credit: NASA, ESA, J. Dalcanton (University of Washington), R.

"New month = new skywatching guide 👻   Make sure to bundle up, and find a safe, dark spot away from bright lights because October has a lot to offer in the night sky. Starting off, the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn are visible throughout the night in October. Early in the evening, you'll find them to the southeast, moving slowly westward with the stars over the course of the night.   Looking to spot the full Moon? Our lunar companion will be in full illumination starting on Oct. 9 and will appear full for about three days. As the full moon after the Harvest Moon, this will be the Hunter's Moon, named that because historically during this period the harvesters have finished reaping the fields, allowing hunters easier sight of the animals that have come out to feed.    Next up, Mars has been steadily moving through the sky in an eastward fashion all year, but at the end of October, Mars halts this apparent motion and then appears to reverse course. From November to late January, Mars is in retrograde. About every two years, Mars appears to change its direction—an illusion caused by the motion of our planet in its orbit passing by the Red Planet in its orbit.  Lastly, look to the skies for a beautiful show throughout October and November as the Orionid meteor shower is active, peaking on the night of Oct. 20. Expect the shower to produce 10-20 meteors per hour at its peak, under clear, dark skies. This year, the Moon will be about 20% full on peak nights so it will interfere slightly but shouldn’t totally spoil the show—best of all, you can observe the meteor showers without any special equipment.   Image Description: An illustrated graphic, with Earth in the foreground with Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars in the background.

"Moonlit nights. 😍  Look to the night sky beginning on Sunday, Oct. 9, 2022, to witness the full Moon as it appears for the next three days.   As the full moon after the Harvest Moon, this will be the Hunter's Moon. The earliest written use of the term ""Hunter's Moon"" identified in the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1710. According to the Farmer's Almanac, farmers have harvested the fields, giving hunters easy sight of the animals that have come out to feed.   The Moon is known by many other names. The Algonquin tribes in what is now the northeastern U.S. called this the Travel Moon, the Dying Grass Moon, or the Sanguine or Blood Moon because of the turning of the leaves during the fall season.

"Missed Connections 💕⁣ ⁣ Upon first view, these two spiral galaxies, which lie more than a billion light-years away from Earth, appear to overlap one another. In actuality, despite appearing to collide in this image, the alignment of the two galaxies is likely just by chance—the two are not actually interacting. ⁣  ⁣ This image is one of many @NASAHubble observations delving into highlights of the Galaxy Zoo project. Originally established in 2007, Galaxy Zoo and its successors are massive citizen science projects that crowdsource galaxy classifications from a pool of hundreds of thousands of volunteers. These volunteers classify galaxies imaged by robotic telescopes and are often the first to ever set eyes on an astronomical object.⁣  ⁣ Over the course of the original Galaxy Zoo project, volunteers discovered a menagerie of weird and wonderful galaxies such as unusual three-armed spiral galaxies and colliding ring galaxies. The astronomers coordinating the project applied for Hubble time to observe the most unusual inhabitants of the Galaxy Zoo—but true to the project’s crowdsourced roots, the list of targets was chosen by a public vote.⁣  ⁣ Image Description: Two galaxies overlapping as capture by the Hubble Space Telescope. In the center of the image two spiraling galaxies are visible overlapping with one another. The uppermost galaxy has an interior of white hues with the otter extremes being more visibly orange. The galaxy on the bottom of the duo is primarily orange with rusty hues.

"Teamwork makes the dream work! ✨  Combining X-ray data from @NASAChandraXray, optical data from @NASAHubble, and infrared data from the retired Spitzer Space Telescope, an international team of astronomers has “wound back the clock” to help determine the timeline of a distant star’s demise.  Located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small galaxy 160,000 light years from Earth, the supernova remnant is the debris from an explosion of a white dwarf star. After reaching a critical mass, either by pulling matter from a neighboring star or by merging with another white dwarf, the star underwent a thermonuclear explosion and was destroyed.   The researchers compared Hubble images of the area from 2010, 2011, and 2020 to measure the speeds of material in the blast wave from the explosion. If the speed was toward the upper end of estimates, the astronomers determined that light from the explosion would have reached Earth about 670 years ago. However, further investigation revealed that it’s likely that debris impacted dense gas after the explosion—slowing down the shockwave and suggesting that the explosion happened more recently than 670 years ago. Astronomers may use additional observations with Hubble to determine more precisely when the time of the star’s demise should truly be set.  Image Description: A composite image from SNR 0519, the remnants of a distant supernova. The center of the image is dominated by the colorful remains of a destroyed star, along the exterior periphery of the debris a thin shell of blood-red wisps of gas as pictured from Hubble optical data.

"It ain’t much but it’s honest work 👨‍🌾  Gaze upon the aptly named ""Crater Farm"" of Venus. This trio of craters on the surface of Venus is caused by the uniquely dense atmosphere of the planet. The thick atmosphere serves as a bulwark against incoming meteorites, breaking them up as they approach the planet’s surface and causing the close cluster of impact craters pictured.   Despite the Crater Farm being one of the planet's most famous locales, Venus has fewer meteor impact craters than the rest of its solar system siblings. Newer estimates reveal that the planet’s extreme volcanic and tectonic forces have reshaped the surface of Venus to an average age of about 150 million years—effectively erasing most traces of its early surface and craters.  The Crater Farm was observed by our Magellan spacecraft in 1991. Magellan, named after the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, scanned over 98% of the surface of Venus in a series of mapping cycles. After successfully surpassing its mission parameters, the spacecraft was commanded to dive into the dense Venusian atmosphere to capture further data. It would be a one-way trip, as after collecting atmospheric data, it burned up in the dense atmosphere of the planet.   Image Description: “The Crater Farm” on the surface of Venus. The torrid volcanic surface of Venus is dominated by craters. The rigid landscape of the planet is shades of brick-like red and hues of orange. Around the impact craters of meteorites, orange hues make way for shades of yellow. Like a bullseye, the center of the impact alternates between a ring of orange and a center circle of yellow.

"From flying a red doghouse to flying a rocket to the Moon 🚀Although the #Artemis I mission to the Moon will be uncrewed, there will be a familiar face aboard the Orion spacecraft. Snoopy will be the zero gravity indicator aboard the capsule, which serves a very important purpose: to visually illustrate when the spacecraft has reached the weightlessness of microgravity. NASA’s relationship with Snoopy began over 50 years ago during the Apollo program. In May 1969, Apollo 10 astronauts Gene Cernan, John Young and Thomas Stafford used the lunar module to skim the Moon’s surface to within 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) and “snoop around” the Apollo 11 landing site. Because of this, the crew named the lunar module “Snoopy” and the Apollo command module was labeled “Charlie Brown,” after Snoopy’s loyal companion.Since the Apollo era, NASA has celebrated achievements related to mission success and human flight safety with the Silver Snoopy Award, a silver pin depicting astronaut Snoopy that has been flown in space. Continuing the tradition, Artemis I will also carry a package of silver snoopy pins for future recognitions.This week is #NASAMoonSnap Pet Week, when we celebrate all our furry, feathered, or scaled friends that make our lives a little brighter.

"Spiraling? It's natural 💁⁣ ⁣ Spirals are everywhere: from the whirlpool of a hurricane to pinwheel-shaped disks around newborn stars, to the vast realms of spiral galaxies across our universe.⁣ ⁣ Astronomers have found young stars spiraling into the center of a massive and oddly shaped stellar nursery in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way located 200,000 light-years away.⁣ ⁣ A spiral is the most efficient way to feed star formation from the outside toward the center. Learning how stars form in the Small Magellanic Cloud offers a new twist on how a firestorm of star birth may have occurred early in the universe's history, when it was undergoing a ""baby boom"" about 2 to 3 billion years after the big bang (the universe is now 13.8 billion years old).

"Baby’s first exoplanet capture 🍼⁣ ⁣ @NASAWebb captured its first image of a planet outside of our solar system—a preview of future observations that will reveal more about exoplanets.⁣ ⁣ While this is not the first direct image of an exoplanet taken from space, HIP 65426 b points the way forward for Webb’s exoplanet exploration.⁣ ⁣ These images show the exoplanet in different bands of infrared light, as seen from Webb’s Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared instrument (MIRI). They look different because of the ways different instruments capture light. A set of masks within each instrument, called a coronagraph, blocks out the host star’s light so that the planet can be seen. The small white star in each image marks the location of the exoplanet’s host star, which has been subtracted using the coronagraphs and image processing. ⁣ ⁣ The exoplanet is a gas giant, meaning it has no rocky surface and could not be habitable. It's about six to 12 times the mass of Jupiter, and young as planets go—about 15 to 20 million years old, compared to our 4.5-billion-year-old Earth.⁣ ⁣ Taking direct images of exoplanets is challenging because stars are so much brighter than planets. The HIP 65426 b planet is more than 10,000 times fainter than its host star in the near-infrared, and a few thousand times fainter in the mid-infrared.⁣ ⁣ Image descriptions: ⁣ 1: Webb’s NIRCam view shows a purple dot with purple bars at 11 & 5 o’clock, which are telescope artifacts, not physically present.

"Tardy for the party.  Satellites captured the waters in Hood Canal, Washington turning turquoise last month. This more typically tropical hue means that the coccolithophores, a type of phytoplankton, have arrived—fashionably late this time.  Coccolithophores have chalky calcium carbonate plates (coccoliths) that reflect light. When they’re present in great numbers, they make even the darkest green or navy blue waters turn a bright blue.  Like most phytoplankton, coccolithophores float near the ocean surface and turn sunlight and carbon dioxide into sugars and oxygen. Coccolithophores also play an important, but not fully understood, role in the global carbon cycle, taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and eventually sinking it to the bottom of the ocean.  This year’s color-changing bloom appeared late, as it took a while to get the right blend of water temperatures. Water in Hood Canal does not always mix well; the upper layers can have different temperatures and salt levels than the deeper layers.

"Our Perseverance Mars rover has obtained rock core samples with the most abundant organic molecules it's ever detected on the Red Planet. These molecules are not a definitive sign of life — organics can be made by many natural processes, including the interaction of rock and water — but one thing is for certain: Perseverance captured the samples it was sent to find.⁣ ⁣ After over a year on Mars, the rover arrived at a fan-shaped rocky outcrop, called “Wildcat Ridge,” where billions of years ago, a river once flowed. The rock cores obtained by Perseverance are each about the size of a piece of classroom chalk. The abundance of organics in the samples is the highest yet found by Perseverance. One of the rocks from Wildcat Ridge is especially high in a certain class of complex organic compounds known as aromatics. The rover's SHERLOC instrument found them all throughout the sample.⁣ ⁣ Organics don't necessarily mean life; they can be geological in origin.

One of only five ever built, and the only one still operational, the Super Guppy has been hauling enormous payloads across the United States for more than 60 years.  The specialized design of the Super Guppy includes a unique hinged nose that allows crews access to its 13-foot-wide (4 meters) and 111-foot-long (34 meters) cargo compartment that's capable of carrying up to 52,500 pounds (23,800 kilograms). In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Super Guppy helped deliver the Saturn V rockets during the Apollo program that landed the first humans on the Moon.

"Giant news from a giant planet! 📰  @NASAWebb captured a new view of Jupiter in infrared light, uncovering clues to the planet’s inner life in a new image. In addition to the planet’s iconic Great Red Spot, two of its moons, rings, and even distant galaxies are visible.  Since infrared light is invisible to humans, the light has been mapped onto the visible spectrum. Generally, the longest wavelengths appear redder and the shortest wavelengths are shown as more blue.  Citizen scientist Judy Schmidt processed these images and turned the raw data collected from Webb's sensors into the visual you see here.  Image Description 1: Jupiter dominates the black background of space. The image is a composite, and shows Jupiter in enhanced color. The planet’s Great Red Spot appears white here. The planet is striated with swirling horizontal stripes of neon turquoise, periwinkle, light pink, and cream. The stripes interact and mix at their edges like cream in coffee. Along both of the poles, the planet glows in turquoise. Bright orange auroras glow just above the planet’s surface at both poles.  Image Description 2: A wide field view showcases Jupiter in the upper right quadrant. The planet’s swirling horizontal stripes are rendered in blues, browns, and cream. Electric blue auroras glow above Jupiter’s north and south poles. A white glow emanates out from the auroras. Along the planet’s equator, rings glow in a faint white. These rings are one million times fainter than the planet itself! At the far left edge of the rings, a moon appears as a tiny white dot. This moon is only about 12 miles (20 km) across. Slightly further to the left, another moon, about 100 miles (150 km) across, glows with tiny white diffraction spikes. The rest of the image is the blackness of space, with faintly glowing white galaxies in the distance.  Credit 1: NASA, ESA, CSA, Jupiter ERS Team; image processing by Judy Schmidt.

"Why so blue? 🔵  Neptune, the eighth planet from the Sun, sometimes referred to as “the other blue planet” has for centuries captivated astronomers with its distinctive blue hue.  The predominant blue color of the planet is a result of the absorption of red and infrared light by Neptune's methane-rich atmosphere. Clouds that escape high above the planet’s methane atmosphere often appear white in color, while the very highest of clouds tend to be visible in shades of yellow-red.   This image was one of the first ever taken by a spacecraft of Neptune. Captured by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, the first (and only) spacecraft to observe the planet. It passed over Neptune’s north pole on Aug. 31, 1989. It took the spacecraft 12 years to reach the planet, and Neptune was Voyager 2’s final target after observing Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.  Since passing Neptune, Voyager 2 has continued its journey onward through the edge of our solar system, and in 2018, became the second spacecraft to reach interstellar space.  Image Description: Neptune’s horizon as pictured by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. Neptune is visible as a light-blue crescent with both points facing downwards at the center of the image. Near the top of the crescent are white wispy clouds of methane high in the atmosphere reminiscent of a feather in the wind. The bottom portion of Neptune below the horizon is a sapphire blue. The background of the image is the same sapphire blue on the left of the image and slowly fades into the dark black of space as it approaches the right of the image.

"Let your light shine. 💅   A brilliant stream of the southern lights or aurora australis is captured in this photograph from the International Space Station (@ISS) as it orbited 270 miles (434 km) above the Indian Ocean near Antarctica.   The vibrant displays of light around Earth’s North and South Poles are caused by the interaction of solar particles, ejected by the Sun, and our planet’s protective magnetic field. Most of the time these interactions are relatively limited and go unnoticed by us on Earth. However, during large solar storms, called coronal mass ejections, the Sun spews large bubbles of electrified gas which collide with our magnetic field at its North and South Poles and enter our atmosphere.  Once in the atmosphere, these energized solar particles collide with atmospheric gases resulting in beautiful displays of light. When solar particles collide with atmospheric oxygen they give off rich red and green hues as seen in this image. Conversely, if these same particles collide with nitrogen in our atmosphere they illuminate the sky in glows of blue and purple.   Earth isn’t the only planet to have auroras. If a planet has an atmosphere and magnetic field, they likely have auroras—as is the case with our solar system neighbor Jupiter, which showed off its beautiful auroras in our last post.   Image Description: A rich stream of the aurora australis or southern lights. The curved horizon of Earth dominates the lower half of the image. Following the curve of the horizon beautiful wisps of green light float above the planet’s surface. Near the upper extremes of the horizon, near where it meets with space, long tall spikes of green light radiate towards the upper half of the image. As the long tall spikes of light reach higher they transition into hues of red. In the upper half of the image, the dark blackness of space dominates, disrupted by the bright white sprinkles of stars visible in the distance. To the far right, the International Space Station covers a section of the image.

"Am I the drama? 🌝   The Perseid meteors are an annual event many skywatchers look forward to, as they often produce lots of shooting stars to enjoy. This year, unfortunately, the Moon had other plans.   Thanks to the nearly full Moon, all but the brightest Perseids will be washed out. Normally, you could see 50-60 meteors per hour in North America, but during this year’s peak, at best 10-20 per hour will be visible. Still, look up if you’re outside around midnight (local time) and dawn on Aug. 13—you may be lucky.   The Perseids are debris remnants of Comet Swift-Tuttle. They often leave long “wakes” of light and color behind them as they streak through Earth's atmosphere. They’re also known for their fireballs, which are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak.

"A light in the darkness. 💡  This time of year, most of the Southern Hemisphere is bathed in hours of winter darkness, but last week the aurora australis (or Southern Lights) faintly lit the night sky several times. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the NASA-NOAA Suomi NPP satellite detects this nighttime light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses filtering techniques to observe signals like city lights, auroras, and reflected moonlight.  When fast-moving electrons from space collide with oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the ionosphere, they become chemically excited. As the gases return to their normal state, they emit small bursts of energy in the form of light (photons). Oxygen molecules and atoms usually glow green, white, or red, while nitrogen tends to be blue or purple. This ghostly light—aurora—originates at altitudes of 100 to 400 kilometers (60 to 250 miles).  As Solar Cycle 25 continues, more sunspots and solar storms are emerging, giving us more chances to see auroras in the northern and southern hemispheres.

"“We’ve got galaxies at home.”  Reminiscent of distant galaxies amid clouds of interstellar dust, this image taken 20 years ago today by the Landsat 7 satellite shows chunks of sea ice drifting through graceful swirls of grease ice in the frigid waters of Foxe Basin near Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic.   Sea ice often begins as grease ice, a soupy slick of tiny ice crystals on the ocean's surface. As the temperature drops, grease ice thickens and coalesces into slabs of more solid ice. Throughout most of the year, the waters of this area are choked with sea ice, but by the end of summer open water typically returns to dominate this part of the Canadian Arctic.

"""The Eagle has landed.""  On this day, 53 years ago, the three astronauts of #Apollo11, Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin, cemented themselves in the chronicles of history for all of humanity by landing Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the surface of the Moon.  Their achievement was made possible by the thousands of people who worked tirelessly toward a common goal, as set by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, and dreamed of by civilizations of old.  In 2021, The UN General Assembly declared that #InternationalMoonDay should be observed on July 20th to signify “International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space.”  As we move closer to our return to the Moon with @NASAArtemis, we prepare new generations for long-term lunar exploration with a focus on international cooperation and teamwork.

Swipe through to see views of the Southern Ring planetary nebula (aka NGC 3132) and its pair of stars, taken by two of Webb’s instruments: NIRCam [1] and MIRI [2]. These two stars put a new spin on “til death do us part.” The dimmer star, locked in orbit with the younger, brighter star, is dying — expelling gas and dust that Webb sees through in unprecedented detail. In fact, Webb reveals for the first time that the dying star is actually cloaked in dust.The stars – and their layers of light – steal more attention in the NIRCam image, while glowing dust plays the lead in the MIRI image. In thousands of years, these delicate, gaseous layers will dissipate into surrounding space.  The Southern Ring nebula is called a planetary nebula. Despite “planet” in the name, which comes from how these objects first appeared to astronomers observing them hundreds of years ago, these are shells of dust and gas shed by dying Sun-like stars. The new details from Webb will transform our understanding of how stars evolve and influence their environments. View and download these new images from Webb at the link in our bio: nasa.gov/webbfirstimages  Credits: NASA, ESA, CSA, and STScI",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cf6pxtbOkPH/,post_990.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14-2jyY6XxJtPRTsvoBHj80dgGYSojUVT

"(Measuring) Dust in the Wind 🎵  Soon, scientists will have a more definite answer to whether mineral dust heats or cools our planet. @NASAEarth's EMIT, or the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation, is now en route to the International Space Station (@ISS) after launching aboard a SpaceX cargo resupply mission on July 14, 2022. Along with EMIT, the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is carrying supplies, food, and new science experiments for the crew aboard the orbiting laboratory.  EMIT is designed to help us better understand how massive plumes of intercontinental dust affect our planet. After it arrives this weekend, EMIT will be installed on the exterior of the space station pointing towards Earth. Using its image spectrometer, it will read light across hundreds of wavelengths to identify the mineral composition of large dust clouds in our atmosphere.   It will study how specks of dust in lighter colors may reflect sunlight back into space, cooling Earth, while darker particles may instead absorb solar radiation and heat our planet. Ultimately, EMIT’s observations will allow scientists to have a deeper understanding of our changing climate.

"👀 SNEAK PEEK: The deepest, sharpest infrared image of the universe ever.⁣ ⁣ @POTUS previewed the very first image released from the James Webb Space Telescope, the world's most powerful space telescope. Capturing this was all in a day’s work. (Literally! Webb captured this image in less than a day, while similar images from Hubble can take weeks.) ⁣ ⁣ If you held a grain of sand to the sky at arm’s length, that speck is the size of Webb’s view here. Imagine — galaxies galore within a grain! Why do some galaxies appear bent? The combined mass of this galaxy cluster acts as a “gravitational lens,” bending the light rays from more distant galaxies behind it, magnifying them. ⁣ ⁣ This isn’t the farthest back we’ve seen. Non-infrared missions like COBE & WMAP saw the universe closer to the Big Bang (about 380,000 years after), when there was microwave background radiation, but no stars or galaxies. Webb sees a few 100 million years after. ⁣ ⁣ View & download Webb’s new image at our link in bio.

"A microwave-sized satellite just launched to the Moon from New Zealand. Meet CAPSTONE.  CAPSTONE's destination? NRHO (or ""near rectilinear halo orbit""), a highly elliptical lunar orbit that swoops within 2,100 miles (3,400 km) of the Moon's surface before swinging out more than 20 times that distance on the far side.   Harnessing the gravity of both Earth and the Moon, this unique orbit is expected to save fuel while providing close-up Moon access—but it's never been flown before. So CAPSTONE will test it out before we use the orbit for Gateway, our future lunar space station that will serve as a second home for @NASAArtemis astronauts as they conduct extended missions on the Moon.

"Cool cosmic waves 🏄‍♀️   What at first sight may appear to be a cosmic current with turquoise-tinted streams and nebulous strands reaching through the stars is the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The brightly glowing plumes of this image capture part of the LMC called the Tarantula Nebula, a small nearby galaxy that orbits our Milky Way and appears as a blurred blob in the night sky.  Traditionally, images of the LMC aren’t so tranquil. For this image @NASAHubble researchers substituted the lens filter which selects red light and replaced it with a filter letting through near-infrared light. The result: the dominant hydrogen gasses which typically present an image brimming in hues of pink are replaced by other less prominent emission lines encompassing shades of blue and green.   Unique data such as this helps shed new light on our understanding of the cosmos. This data is part of a project that gathered together and processed over 1,000 images taken using the Hubble telescope.

In fact, the rings may have been formed much later than the planet itself according to analysis of gravity science data from @NASASolarSystem’s Cassini spacecraft.    The findings indicate that Saturn's rings formed between 10 million and 100 million years ago, which from our planet’s perspective would mean that Saturn’s rings formed during the age of the dinosaurs.

"We feel the need…the need for speed. ✈  You’re looking at one of the first-ever images of shockwaves interacting from two supersonic aircraft in flight. This image of planes moving faster than the speed of sound was captured in 2019. Previously, images of aircraft shockwaves, called Schlieren images, were only achievable in small-scale wind tunnels.  Novel techniques were used to capture colorized composite images which reveal rippling shockwaves representing different densities of compressed air impacting the jets. Although accomplishments in their own right, these innovations will be put to use supporting @nasaaero’s QUESST mission. QUESST, seeks to fly an experimental aircraft, the X-59, at supersonic speed, but instead of producing shockwaves that generate a telltale loud supersonic boom, it will employ technology to minimize its shockwaves into only a quiet sonic thump.   Currently, over-land supersonic flight is prohibited in most of the world, as loud sonic booms disrupt life underneath traveling supersonic aircraft. However, this new imaging technology will allow scientists to collect a wealth of data from QUESST test flights to present to regulators. With data demonstrating the feasibility of technology to enable a new quiet type of supersonic flight regulators may change laws to enable quiet commercial supersonic flight over land—cutting many flight times in half.   Alt text: Two supersonic jets fly in formation, generating shockwaves. In the center of the image are two grey jets diagonal from one another. From the rear of each aircraft, long, straight plumes of orange-colored exhaust are visible in this false-colorized image. Ripples of compressed air impacting the jets are visible emanating from the nose, wings, and rear stabilizers of each jet; the peaks of each ripple are represented in black, and the troughs of the ripples are represented in shades of yellow which dissipate into bright orange.

"In your eyes, there’s a heavy blue.  The wispy blue swirls of the Cygnus Loop nebula are the result of a massive stellar explosion that occurred 5,000 to 8,000 years ago. However, the shockwave from this explosion is still spreading out through space. Supernova remnants like this nebula play an important role in stellar evolution, enriching space with heavy elements and spurring the formation of new stars by compressing stellar gas.  The gas and dust visible here in an ultraviolet (UV) image from our Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) were heated by the shockwave from the supernova.

Active regions are markers of an intense and complex set of magnetic fields hovering in the sun’s atmosphere.  The SDO has kept an unblinking eye on the Sun since 2010, recording phenomena like solar flares and coronal loops. It measures the Sun’s interior, atmosphere, magnetic field, and energy output, helping us understand our nearest star.  Image Description: Bright orange active spots make the shape of two eyes and a grin, making the Sun look like a jack-o-lantern. The rest of the Sun is dark in comparison, with an orange outline distinguishing the star from the darkness of space.

"Good morning, starshine! The Earth says hello. ✨  These scattered specks of light are actually a cosmic menagerie of distant galaxies captured by the @NASAHubble Space Telescope. This massive galaxy cluster, called Abell 1351, lies in the constellation Ursa Major in the Northern Hemisphere.  The odd streaks of light are the result of gravitational lensing, a phenomenon that occurs when massive celestial bodies, such as a galaxy cluster, distort the gravity of space strongly enough to affect the path of light passing through it.  The result: light appears to us as if it passed through a gigantic lens.   Although distorted, observations like this catalog a large array of galaxies for scientists to later investigate in finer detail with Hubble, allowing it to use every second of observing time and maximizing the overall scientific output of the observatory.

"Babe, wake up, a new Martian map just dropped. 🗺   Seen are six views of the Nili Fossae region of Mars captured by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, or CRISM, one of the instruments aboard NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO).  This multicolored 5.6-gigapixel map covers 86% of the Red Planet’s surface and reveals the distribution of dozens of key minerals, the varying colors representing different minerals on the Martian surface seen in different wavelengths of light.   Launched in 2005, the spacecraft has spent the last 16 years mapping the surface of Mars. Since then, CRISM’s maps have been used to select landing sites for other spacecraft, as with Jezero Crater, where our Perseverance Mars rover is exploring an ancient river delta.  To keep its instruments cool enough to make the most accurate infrared mappings of Mars possible it was deployed with three cyrocoolers, that over the extent of its mission have been spent. Although CRISM won’t be making as accurate observations as it once was, it will remain in a standby mode to make additional surveys before eventually being decommissioned.

"See you later, Martian alligator. 🐊  From a distance, the floor of this crater looks like alligator scales or a spider web. The intersecting shapes, or polygons, are common occurrences in the northern lowlands of Mars.  The polygons in this ""patterned ground"" are easy to see because their edges are bound by troughs or ridges covered by bright frost relative to their darker, frost-free interiors. Patterned ground on Mars is thought to form due to cyclic thermal contraction (Martian soil heating and cooling in cycles) causing cracking in the permanently frozen ground.  Scientists study polygonally-patterned ground on Mars because the occurrence and physical characteristics of the polygons help us understand the recent and past distribution of ice (frozen water) in the shallow subsurface. These features also provide clues about climate conditions on the Red Planet's surface.

When Webb observes the light of a star, filtered through the atmosphere of its planet, its spectrographs split up the light into an infrared rainbow. By analyzing that light, scientists can look for the characteristic signatures of specific elements or molecules in the planet’s spectrum. In other words, you can think of this spectrum as a barcode for WASP-96 b’s atmosphere.⁣  ⁣ Located in the southern-sky constellation Phoenix, WASP-96 b is 1,150 light-years away. It’s a large, hot planet with a “puffy” atmosphere, orbiting very close to its Sun-like star. In fact, its temperature is greater than 1000 degrees F (537 degrees C) — significantly hotter than any planet in our solar system. ⁣  ⁣ (The background illustration is based on what we know of WASP-96 b.

"The planets Uranus and Neptune have a lot in common, yet they’re different colors. Why?Astronomers may now have the clues. Both planets have a layer of concentrated haze, but new research suggests Uranus (first image) has a thicker layer, ""whitening"" its appearance more than Neptune’s. If there were no haze in the atmospheres of Neptune and Uranus, both would appear almost equally blue.An international team led by Patrick Irwin, Professor of Planetary Physics at Oxford University, made this conclusion, and developed a model to describe aerosol layers in the atmospheres of Neptune and Uranus. They suspect that methane ice condenses onto the particles in the middle layer of both planets, creating a shower of methane snow. Neptune is more efficient at churning up these particles in its turbulent atmosphere, removing most of the haze.  The above images were taken by our Voyager 2 spacecraft during flybys in 1986 and 1989, respectively.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech#Uranus #Neptune #Planets #Atmosphere #Blue #Haze #Space #Astronomy #NASA",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cew1hKcpDA5/,post_1017.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Qx_d0na-G0uBWNIj5KSH8KE7jQbo06P-

"Raaaays and rings and… Cygni, Cygni⁣ ⁣ 7,800 light years away from Earth, a black hole in a binary system called V404 Cygni pulls matter from a nearby companion star, forming it into a disk around itself. This process creates the light echoes we see here, appearing as blue concentric rings against a field of stars.⁣ ⁣ As the black hole pulls in star matter, X-rays are emitted. These X-rays travel through space, passing through dust clouds that scatter some of the X-rays toward us. Depending on the content of the dust clouds, different amounts of the X-rays will be absorbed and not detected with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, just like how different parts of our bodies absorb different amounts of X-rays.⁣ ⁣ By comparing the brightness of the X-rays to computer models of dust with different compositions, researchers determined that the dust between V404 Cygni and Earth most likely contains mixtures of graphite and silicate grains.⁣ ⁣ Credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/U.Wisc-Madison/S.

"Dust in the wind. 💨  Swipe to see what 1,211 Martian days, or sols, of exposure to the elements of Mars, looks like.  Our InSight Mars lander took its final selfie on April 24, 2022. Covered in a layer of dust, the second image displays the lander after operating in a limited capacity unable to generate the power levels of yesteryear.   The InSight Mars lander arrived on Mars on Nov. 26, 2018, powered by solar panels and equipped with instruments designed to measure Mars’ interior. The lander recorded invaluable weather data and studies of the remnants of Mars’ ancient magnetic field, as well as analysis of quakes that allowed scientists to measure the depth and composition of Mars’ crust, mantle, and core.  Since achieving its mission goals in its first Martian year (two Earth years) InSight has operated in an extended mission phase. However, as dust continues to accumulate on its panels less and less power is available. To continue its operation, power must be prioritized for the lander's seismometer, the instrument which measures marsquakes. At the current rate, InSight is expected to continue limited operation until about December when it will send its final signal home.

"Dust: it's coarse and rough and irritating — and it gets everywhere.   Blown by wind across continents and oceans, dust does more than make skies hazy, congest lungs, and leave a film on windshields—it can influence weather, hasten snowmelt, and fertilize plants on land and in the ocean. Particles from North Africa can travel thousands of miles around the globe, sparking phytoplankton blooms, seeding Amazonian rainforests with nutrients, and blanketing some American cities in a veil of grit while also absorbing and scattering sunlight.   Our Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) mission set to launch next month aims to help us better understand how these drifting intercontinental dusts affect our planet. Currently, we are unsure whether mineral dust heats or cools our planet: for instance, specks of dust in lighter colors may reflect sunlight back into space, cooling our planet, while darker particles may absorb solar energy and heat Earth. As climate change causes more lands to become dry and arid dust-forming regions, we need to better understand how they impact our future climate.    Once in orbit, EMIT will be attached to the exterior of the @iss pointing towards Earth. There, it will use its imaging spectrometer to measure light across hundreds of wavelengths, including those that are invisible to human eyes. These spectrometer readings will help us understand the mineral composition of large dust plumes and better prepare us for our changing climate.

The capsule’s return to Earth wrapped up a six-day trip to the International Space Station (@ISS) as part of Orbital Flight Test-2, a flight test to help certify Boeing’s crew transportation system for regular flights with astronauts to and from the space station.Starliner launched to the space station on Thursday, May 19 aboard a @ULALaunch Atlas V rocket, and docked to the orbiting laboratory on Friday, May 20. The spacecraft returned home with more than 600 pounds (272 kilograms) of cargo, including Nitrogen Oxygen Recharge System reusable tanks that provide breathable air to station crew members. The tanks will be refurbished on Earth and sent back to the station on a future flight. Although the mission was uncrewed, there was one passenger strapped into the commander’s seat: Rosie the Rocketeer.

"Where does the rainbow end?  Pluto isn’t really a psychedelic riot of colors—this translated color image was created by New Horizons scientists to highlight the many subtle color differences between the planet’s distinct regions.  Pluto has a complex, varied surface with jumbled mountains reminiscent of Europa, networks of carved-out valleys, old, heavily cratered terrain sitting right next to new, smooth icy plains, and even what might be wind-blown dunes.  New Horizons launched on January 19, 2006 and conducted a six-month-long flyby study of Pluto and its moons in summer 2015. The spacecraft continues to explore the distant solar system, heading farther into the Kuiper Belt.

"Shelled galaxies have an appetite 🍽️This new @NASAHubble space telescope image captures the central region of this gigantic elliptical galaxy located about 100 million light-years from Earth. This galaxy is so large it spans about 250,000 light-years across, which is about 2.5x larger than our own Milky Way Galaxy. The cause of the shell is unknown, but astronomers theorize that it may be the aftereffects of the giant galaxy absorbing one or more smaller galaxies. Imagine the way a pebble creates ripples on a pond when dropped in the water – this is the same effect the absorbed galaxy creates that forms the shell. Elliptical galaxies with shelled structures usually lie in relatively empty space – it may be that they’ve cannibalized their surrounding neighbors.Credit: NASA @EuropeanSpaceAgency, and D.

"6,000 candles in the wind. 💨  Spring in the Northern Hemisphere means many things: flowers are in bloom, days are getting longer, and animals head north for the summer. In the skies above the Labrador Sea, spring brings “cloud streets” or parallel bands of cumulus clouds.    The “cloud streets” pattern results from strong, cold winds blowing over the relatively warmer sea, pushing warm air toward the frigid air. This air movement causes a temperature inversion warm (air on top of cold air), which acts as a cap and causes the air to roll over and form parallel cylinders of rotating air. Clouds form on the upper side of these cylinders (the rising air). Along the downward side (descending air), skies are clear.   This image was captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on our Aqua satellite. Aqua’s primary mission is to study Earth’s water cycle, including evaporation from oceans, sea ice, land ice, water vapor in the atmosphere, and cloud formation.

The creation of these stars is causing some peculiar galactic weather – known as a superwind – gigantic movements of gas throughout the galaxy, which is invisible in this picture due to it not being on visible wavelengths imaged by Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3.  Two supernovae occurred in this galaxy in the last decade, the first happened in 2014 and the second in 2019, the star that led to the 2019 supernova was 19 times as massive as our Sun.

"A flare for the dramatic 🎭  Our Sun has been a little extra over the last two weeks with five moderate to strong solar flares – sudden releases of magnetic energy. Since April 19, three of them were classified as strong. The Sun emits solar flares occasionally, though they don’t always impact humans on Earth.

"It was a rocky visit ☄   This runaway point of light pictured by the @NASAHubble Space Telescope is the Comet Borisov, named after amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov who first observed it in 2019. It’s the first confirmed comet to enter our solar system from some unknown place beyond our Sun’s influence.    Comets are snowballs of ice, dust and frozen gas. Their frozen nucleus can be about the size of a small town, but when heated by the Sun their tails can extend for millions of miles! Borisov is about the length of nine football fields, or 0.61 miles (0.98 kilometers), making it relatively small.    All comets form in the disk of material that encircles a young star, preserving remnants of a planetary system’s ancient past. Comets from our own solar neighborhood reveal the history of materials, including water, that made Earth the planet we know today, as well as our other planetary neighbors. On the other hand, an interstellar comet like Borisov is a chemical ambassador from an entirely different star system—containing a treasure trove of clues to worlds too far to reach with modern technology.   Specifically, it has a higher concentration of carbon monoxide than any comet seen at a similar distance; suggesting that Borisov may have originated around the most common type of star in the Milky Way: a red dwarf.   #CometBorisov #Comet #Space #AstroPhotography #Hubble #NASA #Sun #Science #Astronomer #Astronomy",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CceA06SLKGO/,post_1076.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1F0eqv9adN0NtE_4SdhsB9M_S8x2NYGJr

"A beautiful space butterfly! 🦋   What looks like a cosmic red butterfly at first glance is in reality a nursery for hundreds of baby stars, revealed in this infrared image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. This space butterfly is a nebula—a giant cloud of gas and dust in space where new stars may form. The butterfly's two ""wings"" are giant bubbles of hot, interstellar gas blowing from the hottest, most massive stars in this region.   Besides being beautiful, this nebula demonstrates how the formation of stars results in the destruction of the very clouds that helped create them. Inside giant clouds of gas and dust in space, the force of gravity pulls material together into dense clumps. Sometimes these clumps reach a critical density that allows stars to form at their cores. Radiation and winds coming from the most massive stars in those clouds—combined with the material spewed into space when those stars eventually explode—sometimes form bubbles like those pictured here. But these processes also disperse the gas and dust, breaking up dense clumps and reducing or halting further new star formation. In fact, the material that forms this nebula’s wings was ejected from a dense cluster of stars that lies between them.    Another cluster of stars, named Serpens South, can be seen to the upper right of the butterfly in this image. Although both Serpens South and the cluster at the heart of the pictured nebula are young in astronomical terms (less than a few million years old), Serpens South is the younger of the two. Its stars are still embedded within their cloud but will someday break out to produce bubbles like those captured in this image.   #AstroPhotography #Space #Nebula #Cosmos #Stars #Butterfly #ABugsLife #Spitzer #SpitzerTelescope #Galaxy #metamorphosis #NASA",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CcV2Ck3O6ph/,post_1079.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1V1TnRyiFZeSMshyjoOqbI18DCc2ZfjTr

For one, Jupiter has four major moons that often pass between Jupiter and the Sun. In just one week, Ganymede transits once; Europa, twice; and Io, four times. And since Jupiter’s moons orbit in a plane close to Jupiter’s orbital plane, the moon shadows are often cast upon the planet.Citizen scientist Thomas Thomopoulos created this enhanced-color image using raw data from the JunoCam instrument.

"Seeing the sun rise every 90 minutes? Yes, please! 🌅  This image of an orbital sunrise was captured aboard the International Space Station (@ISS) about 250 miles above Earth. In the image, streams of sunlight beam across Earth’s horizon revealing the silhouetted clouds above the South China Sea  High above Earth, the ISS travels at over 4.76 miles (7.66 km) per second. Traveling at such high speeds around the Earth means that every 24 hours the crew of the ISS orbits our planet 16 times—witnessing 16 sunrises and sunsets!  For sunrises like this, there is more than meets the eye. The beautiful azure blue streaks are caused by sunlight making contact with Earth’s atmosphere. The visible spectrum of light is comprised of many different colors, all of which have different frequencies and wavelengths. The frequency of blue light is fast and has short wavelengths, making it easier for the blue wavelengths in sunlight to be scattered in all directions by meeting the gases and particles in our atmosphere—making much of the sky blue.  The rich shades of orange are caused by a similar phenomenon. Closer to the horizon, as sunlight travels through Earth’s atmosphere, it must travel an even greater distance. As the light travels this longer path, more and more of the shorter, bluer wavelengths of light are scattered away, leaving more of the longer, redder wavelengths for our eyes to see. ___ Image description: A thin stripe of blue sky becomes visible as a band of sunlight beams across Earth’s horizon bisecting the predominantly black image and revealing silhouetted clouds.  #Sunrise #Light #Sun #Horizon #Wavelengths #Frequency #Spectrum #Prism #Rainbow #ISS #NASA #Space #Atmosphere #Science",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CcOl4Lvtqwg/,post_1083.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1WRidvLS-CmB0sgsUDoeclezSnBkIh_iy

"Did someone say “Encore?” 🎸Last week our star gave back-to-back performances. On Mar. 30, 2022, the Sun emitted a significant solar flare, peaking at 1:35 pm EST (5:35 pm UTC). Followed by a mid-level solar flare that peaked at 2:35 pm EST (6:35 pm UTC) the following day. Our Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the Sun constantly, was able to capture both events. The first graphic shows the significant solar flare, a bright flash on the top right portion which shows a subset of extreme ultraviolet light that highlights the extremely hot material in flares, colorized in yellow.

"It’s not the years…it’s the mileage 🤠  Scientists studying the origins of our galaxy can sometimes feel like they are cosmic archeologists, uncovering the building blocks of our galaxy’s earliest days. One way astronomers can get a better sense of the foundations of our solar system is by observing ancient stellar relics like white dwarf stars, the immensely dense remnants of once-massive stars.   @NASAHubble captured a collection of these galactic monuments 26,000 light-years from Earth. These primordial remains are from stars that formed quickly, at least on a cosmic timescale, in less than 2 billion years. Since we know the location of these white dwarf stars, we can tell how fast and far they move compared to the rest of our galaxy.   Credit: NASA, ESA, A. Calamida and K.

"April 2022 starts off with a little togetherness: Venus, Mars and Saturn form a trio in the southeast before sunrise, with Saturn moving closer to Mars every day. Around April 5, Saturn will move past Mars. By mid-month, Jupiter joins the three planets, forming a line in the sky. Venus and Jupiter also head for a conjunction around April 30. While these planets will look like they’re very close, they’re actually far from each other.  The Big Dipper is a wonderful reference for finding your way using the night sky, but it also holds a secret… What looks like a single star midway along the Dipper’s handle is actually two stars, Mizar and Alcor, bound together by gravity. In April, clear dark skies will make it easier to distinguish the two. Mizar and Alcor are a rare example of double stars that you can see without a telescope, so take a look outside to spot the pair!

"Okay, I like it, Picasso! 🖼  This cosmic portrait—captured with the Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3–shows a stunning view of a spiral galaxy, which lies approximately 60 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Coma Berenices. This constellation – whose name translates as Bernice’s Hair – was named after an Egyptian queen who lived more than 2,200 years ago.  As majestic as spiral galaxies like this are, they are far from the largest structures known to astronomers. In fact, this spiral galaxy is part of the Virgo cluster, which contains more than a thousand galaxies. This cluster is in turn part of the larger Virgo supercluster, which also encompasses the Local Group containing our own galaxy, the Milky Way.  This image comes from a large program of observations designed to produce a treasure trove of combined observations from two great observatories: @NASAHubble and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). ALMA is a vast telescope consisting of 66 high-precision antennas high in the Andes Mountains of Chile, which together observe at wavelengths between infrared and radio waves. This allows ALMA to detect the clouds of cool interstellar dust which give rise to new stars. Meanwhile, Hubble’s razor-sharp observations at ultraviolet wavelengths allow astronomers to pinpoint the location of hot, luminous, newly formed stars. Together, the ALMA and Hubble observations provide a vital repository of data to astronomers studying star formation, as well as laying the groundwork for future science with the @NASAWebb Telescope.

"Make sure you pick the best filter 📸  This photo of a barred spiral galaxy 48 million light-years from Earth, taken by @NASAHubble, is a cosmic wonder. In its original form, though, it wouldn't look nearly as dazzling—raw images from Hubble and other space telescopes come in shades of gray, only showing the amount of light captured across all wavelengths the telescope's camera can measure.  In order to turn those images into colorful sights like this one, we take photos with special filters that block out almost all wavelengths of light. One of the filters used on this image sees only light that would appear green to human eyes: light at wavelengths around 555 nanometers.

"A Cosmic Flower in Bloom 🌸  Captured in all of its glory by our Spitzer Space Telescope, this delicate cosmic ""flower"" can be found in the Ring Nebula. The outer shell of this planetary nebula is formed from material ejected from a dying star. Despite the star decaying, it releases a beautiful display that looks surprisingly similar to the delicate petals of a camellia blossom.  The “ring” in the center of the image is a thick cylinder of glowing gas and dust around the doomed star. As the star begins to run out of fuel, its core becomes smaller and hotter, boiling off its outer layers.  Spitzer's infrared array camera detected this material expelled from the withering star. Previous images of the Ring Nebula taken by visible-light telescopes usually showed just the inner glowing loop of gas around the star. The outer regions resembling petals are especially prominent in this image because Spitzer saw infrared light from hydrogen molecules that absorbed ultraviolet radiation from the star, or were heated by powerful winds from the star.  Located about 2,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra, this is one of the best examples of a planetary nebula, and a favorite target of amateur astronomers.

"Listen to 5,000 worlds beyond our solar system 🔊  This week, we announced that we have now confirmed the existence of over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets known to exist outside of our home star system. From small, rocky Earth-sized worlds to gas giants many times larger than Jupiter, we've been looking for more than 30 years to find these exoplanets' subtle signals: the dimming of a distant star as a planet passes in front of it, or a small shift in the star's movement from its planet's gravity.  With new telescopes like @NASAWebb and cutting-edge technology, we're discovering more worlds than ever—and even starting to capture direct images. We're learning that there are likely hundreds of billions of planets across the Milky Way!  This video is a sonification of all 5,005 confirmed exoplanets, turning their discovery over time into music-like sound. As each exoplanet is discovered, a circle appears at its position in the sky. The size of the circle indicates the relative size of the planet's orbit and the color indicates which planet detection method was used to discover it: pink corresponds to radial velocity, purple to planetary transit, green to microlensing, red to timing variations, yellow to orbital brightness modulation, gray to astrometry, and blue to disk kinematics.  The music is created by playing a note for each newly discovered world. The pitch of the note indicates the relative orbital period of the planet. Planets that take a longer time to orbit their stars are heard as lower notes, while planets that orbit more quickly are heard as higher notes.   Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/M. Russo, A.

"It's a latte bigger than Earth. ☕️   This picture isn’t from your local coffee shop, it’s from our spacecraft Juno as it passed by Jupiter. Jupiter is well known for its Great Red Spot, but it’s also home to anticyclonic storms, known as white ovals. White oval’s can be storms the size of earth and can generate winds up to 335 miles per hour (539 kilometers per hour) and some storms can reach 60 miles (100 kilometers) tall.    Jupiter is strapped with “belts” of white and red, that wrap around the planet. Traveling both east and west, why these belts are distinct is something mystery to scientists, one possibility is that the ammonia gas in the atmosphere travels up and down in alignment with the planets jet streams.    Juno’s prime mission of measuring and studying Jupiter’s atmosphere and magnetic structure was completed in 2021, but it will continue to measure the planet’s unique structure until at least 2025.

"The stars are aligning...so to speak. ⭐️On March 11, the @NASAWebb Space Telescope team fully aligned the observatory’s mirrors with its primary imager, keeping its optics on track to meet or exceed science goals. “We now know we have built the right telescope,” said Ritva Keski-Kuha, deputy optical telescope element manager for Webb at @NASAGoddard. First science images are expected in about three months.So what do we see here? While the purpose of this image was to focus on the bright star at the center for alignment evaluation, Webb's optics and NIRCam imager are so sensitive that the galaxies and stars seen in the background show up. Each of the primary mirror segments have been adjusted to produce one unified image of the same star using only the NIRCam instrument. A red filter was used to enhance visual contrast. The next image shows a new “selfie,” created using a special lens inside of NIRCam. The lens is strictly for engineering purposes.Once fully operational, Webb will help solve mysteries in our solar system, look beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probe the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it.

"You're a shining star no matter who you are 🎶🎶🎶  Hydrogen is the most ubiquitous element in the cosmos; from the biggest star to the smallest single cell organism, hydrogen is the universal connector. It is the most abundant element in the universe, and even in the human body.  This nebula is glowing with hydrogen gas, and filled with enormous stars, dust, and … a bubble? The “superbubble” in this nebula is about 250 light-years wide and scientists aren’t entirely sure why it formed the way it did. Stellar winds generated by massive stars in the interior of the “bubble” may have moved the ionized gas away from the center; another possibility is massive stars dying, resulting in huge explosions carving out the “bubble.”  @NASAHubble captured this nebula located about 170,000 light-years away, and is classified is as an emission nebula, which is a nebula whose gas has been energized or ionized by radiation of nearby stars. As the gas begins to cool from a higher-energy state to a lower-energy state, it emits energy which in turn causes the nebula to glow.  Credit: NASA, @EuropeanSpaceAgency, V. Ksoll and D.

"Dream big, little star. 👶⭐  An energetic outburst from an infant star streaks across this image from the @NASAHubble Space Telescope. This stellar tantrum – produced by an extremely young star in the earliest phase of formation – consists of an incandescent jet of gas traveling at supersonic speeds. The colorful wisps, found in the lower left of the image, are painted onto the sky by a young star swaddled in the partially illuminated cloud of obscuring dust seen to the upper right.  Pictured punching through the enshrouding dust is an extremely hot, blue jet of gas released by the young star. As this jet speeds through space, it collides with cooler surrounding material. The result is the colorful object to the lower left, produced as the cooler material is heated by the jet.   This wispy object resides near the Orion Nebular approximately 1,400 light-years away from Earth. Only a fraction of the entire jet extending between the infant star and the wispy object— called a Herbig-Haro object — is visible using the Hubble telescope. But with the introduction of @NASAWebb, which observes at predominantly infrared wavelengths, we will be able to peer into the dusty envelopes surrounding still-forming infant stars such as this, revolutionizing the study of jets from these young stars.

"Got some stardust in your eyes? 🤩A pair of cosmic dust bunnies are pictured here by @NASAHubble. The dark tendrils threading through both galaxies are made from galactic dust. While beautiful, they add complexities to observing the galaxies. Dust in the universe tends to scatter and absorb blue light, making stars appear dimmer and redder in a process called “reddening.” The dusty pair lie in the constellation Virgo but are not as similar as they appear. One galaxy is 47 million light-years from Earth while the other is 212 million light-years away. The enormous distances between the two galaxies means that they are not interacting and only appear to overlap because of a chance alignment from our earthly perspective. Astronomers create maps of the dust in the foreground galaxy’s spiral arms, by measuring how dust in the foreground galaxy affects starlight from the background galaxy. These “dust maps” help researchers calibrate measurements of everything from cosmological distances to the types of stars that call these galaxies home. Credit: NASA/ @EuropeanSpaceAgency/Hubble, T.

"👀 What do you see in the image?    A mini @NASAWebb telescope, or perhaps two starfighters from a galaxy far, far away?   These are a few of the many snowflake images collected by NASA’s IMPACTS mission, which studies the snowstorms common to the Northeastern U.S.   And just how does the mission collect these particle samples?    By flying directly into snowstorms of course! The instruments and probes attached to the P-3 aircraft are able to collect samples to measure snow particles and atmospheric properties within the storm clouds.   Each of the aircraft's instruments has a special use: taking high-definition photos of ice particles, measuring the total amount of water (both in liquid and ice form), measuring the size of full and partial snow particles, and sampling shattered particles. These data-collecting tools can sample over 30 million particles in a single eight-hour flight alone.   But it’s not just being “stormtroopers” flying into snowstorms—the campaign combines satellite data, ground-based radars, weather balloon launches, and computer simulations to understand snowstorms. The goal of the mission is to develop greater comprehension of winter storm formation and development by using several instruments that examine the microphysical characteristics of snow particles at various temperatures and altitudes. The data collected during the multi-year IMPACTS campaign will help advance snowfall remote sensing interpretation and modeling to significantly improve the future of snowstorm forecasting and prediction capabilities.

"There are three sides to this story 👇A triangular star-birthing frenzy is fueled by a spectacular collision between two galaxies in this image captured by @NASAHubble. Astronomers suggest that as the galaxies passed by each other they ignited the uniquely-shaped star-formation firestorm, where thousands of stars are bursting to life on the right-hand side of the image. The gravitational tussle between the two galaxies shows their differences: the galaxy on the left contains old stars and no new star birth because it lost its gas long ago, well before this galactic encounter. This is the galaxy responsible for yanking taffy-like strands of gas from its partner, stoking the streamers of young, blue stars that appear to form a bridge between the two galaxies.The galaxy on the right is home to younger stars no older than 1 million to 2 million years forming close to its center – Hubble’s sharpness reveals even some individual stars. They are among the brightest and most massive in the galaxy. Most of the brilliant blue clumps are groupings of stars. The pink blobs are giant, young, star clusters still enshrouded in dust and gas.Credit: NASA, @EuropeanSpaceAgency, STScI, Julianne Dalcanton (Center for Computational Astrophysics / Flatiron Inst. and University of Washington); Image Processing: Joseph DePasquale (STScI)#NASA #Cosmos #Hubble #Galaxies #AstroPhotography #Triangles #Space #Stars",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CalEwOgp4fp/,post_1115.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1S2iRb_WjOgFNKujNLZH1bT0psHOJekB7

While it is only one of 53 of Jupiter’s named moons, it is the only moon that has its own internally generated magnetic field.  The complex surface of Jupiter’s moon Ganymede is captured here from our Juno mission’s close pass of the giant moon in June 2021. At closest approach, the spacecraft came just within just 650 miles (1,046 kilometers) of Ganymede’s surface. This image taken by the JunoCam shows one of the dark-rayed craters, named Kittu. Most of Ganymede’s craters have bright rays extending from the impact scar, but only 1% of the craters have dark rays.

"The world’s largest salt flat📍Bolivia’s Salar de Uyuni is a salt flat that for most of the year is a large expanse of white salt crust as large as 4,000 square miles (10,000 sq km). During rainy season, water can fill part of the salt flat and give it an incredible mirror-like appearance. However, in 2022 the watery mirror grew larger and lingered longer than it had for several years, which is probably related in to the La Niña event. Strong La Niñas during the rainy season are related to positive rainfall anomalies in the southern Altiplano.This is a natural-colored image acquired on Jan. 31 by the Operational Landsat Imager on Landsat 8.

"Astronomy's Antihero 🦸Black holes get a bad rap. They’re seen as hungry monsters that gobble up planets and stars, but recent evidence captured by the @NASAHubble shows otherwise. In the heart of a dwarf galaxy, a black hole is creating stars - contributing to a firestorm of new star formation taking place in the galaxy. This is the opposite effect of what’s seen in larger galaxies, where material falling toward the black hole is whisked away by surrounding magnetic fields, forming blazing jets of plasma moving close to the speed of light. Gas clouds caught in the path of these jets are heated beyond their ability to cool down and form stars. But with a less-massive black hole like the one in this dwarf galaxy, its gentler outflow compresses gas just enough to create a new star formation. Credit: NASA, @EuropeanSpaceAgency, Zachary Schutte (XGI), Amy Reines (XGI); Image Processing: Alyssa Pagan (STScI) #NASA #BlackHoles #NASAHubble #Astronomy #Stars #Galaxy #Space",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CZvIUuQJ9eG/,post_1132.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NtONmxMbguLFl1eJ-4G8jfNvI3eCmG15

"Keeping Up with the Kosmos 💅  @NASAHubble captured an interacting galaxy pair. Although it's hard to tell from this image, the two galaxies have incredibly energetic cores, also known as active galactic nuclei (AGN). If this same image reflected the full emission of both AGNs, their brilliance would hide the detail of the galactic pair photographed here.   When an object causes another object to change or stretch this is considered a tidal force. The delicate streams of matter link the two galaxies together, as the direction of the tidal forces is away from the lower mass galaxy and toward the higher mass galaxy. Gas, dust, and even star systems could move toward one galaxy and away from the other as a result of tidal forces.   The way galaxies evolve has a lot to do with the way they interact with one another. Merging, colliding or just brushing past are all interactions that could significantly affect their shape and structure.

"Mr. Worldwide 😎  After a record-setting 355 continuous days aboard the International Space Station (@ISS), Mark Vande Hei of @NASAAstronauts is expected to return home on March 30, 2022. Vande Hei’s stint aboard the ISS breaks the previous NASA record, held by retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, by 15 days.  While clocking the single longest spaceflight by a NASA astronaut, Vande Hei contributed to dozens of studies from the hundreds executed during his mission. From growing vegetables in space, to measuring the effectiveness of enhanced spaceflight diets—the results of the studies Vande Hei participated in could help to pave the way for more people to travel to space on longer-duration missions as NASA pushes the boundaries of exploration to the Moon and Mars.   After his return to the surface of Earth, Vande Hei will provide additional feedback to researchers investigating potential injuries such as bruises incurred by astronauts from the force of landing. This feedback will help scientists better understand whether long-term human spaceflight makes crew members more susceptible to such injuries.  Through Vande Hei’s work, NASA will expand its knowledge about how the human body adapts to long-term spaceflight as we plan for future missions to the Moon and Mars.  From all of us at NASA, thank you for your service, Mark, and congratulations!

In this lab is where astronauts train for spacewalks, and soon, moonwalks. @NASAAstronauts are no strangers to extreme environments. We best prepare them by exposing them to training environments here on Earth that simulate the 1/6th gravity, suit mobility, lighting and lunar terrain they'll expect to see on a mission to the Moon. When astronauts go to the Moon’s South Pole through @NASAArtemis program, the Sun will only be a few degrees over the horizon, creating long, dark shadows. To recreate this environment, divers at the lab turned off the lights, put up black curtains on the pool walls to minimize reflection, and used powerful underwater lamps to simulate the environment astronauts might experience on lunar missions. The sand at the bottom is common pool filter sand with some other specialized combinations in the mix.This was a test with divers in SCUBA gear to get the lighting conditions right, but soon, NASA plans to conduct tests in this low-light environment using spacesuits.Credit: NASA #NASA #Science #Moonwalker #UnderwaterAesthetic #Simulation #Exploration #Lights #LowLightPhotography",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CZngblBpqMj/,post_1142.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1vgt9C2vFGoXd3k0LP6WTMMFB6dqH9FQd

The Cygnus spacecraft has been named S.S. Piers Sellers, in dedication to the former astronaut and climate scientist who was instrumental in constructing the @ISS.Along with supplies and food, materials supporting over 250 current and future science investigations are on their way to the orbital lab, including:▪️ Colgate Skin Aging, which will study cellular and molecular changes in engineered human skin cells in microgravity. Microgravity can lead to changes in the body that are like aging, but can happen much more quickly and can be more easily studied.▪️ MicroQuin 3D Tumor, which will examine effects of a therapeutic on breast and prostate cancer cells. These cells can grow in a more natural 3D model in microgravity, allowing more insight into their cellular characteristics.▪️ XROOTS will use hydroponic (water-based) and aeroponic (air-based) techniques to grow plants, reducing overall system mass. Current systems for growing plants in space use soil or growth medium.Tune in as @NASAAstronauts @Astro_Raja and @Astro_Kayla capture the Cygnus spacecraft with the station’s robotic arm.

"What’s cooler than being cool? Ice cold. ❄️  On average, the surface temperature on Pluto is -387° F (-232° C), making it too cold to sustain life as we know it.  Today we say happy birthday to Pluto’s discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh, who in 1930 at Lowell Observatory in Arizona was the first to spot the dwarf planet. Pluto was named by then 11-year-old Venetia Burney, whose suggestion was passed along to the observatory by her grandfather.  This photo, taken by the New Horizons spacecraft on the departure end of its historic flyby, shows the Sun's rays as they pass through Pluto’s atmosphere at a distance of 120,000 miles (200,000 kilometers).  Scientists believe the spectacular blue haze is a photochemical smog resulting from the action of sunlight on methane and other molecules in Pluto's atmosphere. These hydrocarbons accumulate into small haze particles, which scatter blue sunlight—the same process that can make haze appear bluish on Earth.  From its discovery to the time it was classified as a dwarf planet, Pluto had yet to make a complete revolution around the Sun.

"Main character energy 🔥The Sun emitted a mid-level solar flare this morning, peaking at around 1:01 am EST (06:01 UTC). Our Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), which observes the sun constantly, captured these images of the event. Solar flares are powerful bursts of energy. They usually take place in active regions, which are areas on the Sun marked by the strong presence of magnetic fields. As these magnetic fields evolve, they can reach a point of instability and release energy in many forms, including electromagnetic radiation, which is what is observed as solar flares. Flares and solar eruptions can impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals, and pose risks to spacecrafts and astronauts. In true main character fashion, we treat the Sun as if our world revolves around it!

Look for meteors after midnight local time, after the constellation they appear to originate from, Boötes, rises above the horizon.   ☄️ This tends to be one of the better meteor showers of the year and often produces bright meteors called fireballs!   A few days later, look for the Moon with Jupiter on Jan. 5 in the west, and with Mars and Venus on Jan. 29 in the east. Venus is now appearing in the morning after being ""the Evening Star"" in 2021, and Mars is returning to the skies after its solar conjunction last fall, where it passed behind the Sun as seen from Earth.

"💫 Welcome to your new home, @NASAWebb.  On Jan. 24, the James Webb Space Telescope arrived at its final destination about 1 million miles, or 1.5 million kilometers, from Earth. For its entire mission, Webb will orbit at what’s called Lagrange point 2 (L2), a point in space that balances the gravitational pull of Earth and the Sun. Orbiting the Sun in line with Earth at L2 keeps the telescope's instruments super cold and allows it to observe the sky at any moment.  At 2 p.m. EST (19:00 UTC), teams on Earth commanded Webb to fire its onboard thrusters for nearly five minutes to complete the final course correction burn. This allowed the spacecraft to park itself into L2.  Now that Webb’s primary mirror segments and secondary mirrors have been deployed, engineers will begin the sophisticated three-month process of aligning the telescope’s optics to nearly microscopic precision, with some movements as small as 10 nanometers — only one-ten thousandth the width of a human hair. From now until about June 2022, Webb will calibrate its instruments and continue to cool down so it can #UnfoldTheUniverse.   What do you think Webb will discover?

"""The vast loneliness is awe-inspiring, and it makes you realize just what you have back there on Earth."" – Jim LovellOn Dec. 24, 1968, Apollo 8 astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders became the first humans to orbit the Moon and the first to witness the Earth rising above the Moon's barren surface. That evening they held a live broadcast from lunar orbit, in which they showed pictures of the Earth and Moon as seen from their spacecraft.The mission is known for this iconic ""Earthrise"" image, snapped by Anders, which would give humankind a new perspective on our home planet.

"Baby, it’s icy outside. 🧊This icefield of the southern Andes mountains was captured by an astronaut aboard the International Space Station (@ISS). The mountain peaks here reach high enough and temperatures remain cold enough year-round that permanent ice persists amid a warming world. It was significantly larger about 18,000 years ago, during the coldest phase of the last Ice Age, covering almost the entire view in this image—an enormous area considering that the present icefield is more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) long.Glacial ice moves slowly downhill under its own weight. As it flows, it cuts valleys into the underlying rocks. There have been several ice ages in the past, and scientists now know that the lakes at the top of this image and the network of valleys (fjords) at the bottom were gouged out by the erosion of moving glacial ice when the icefields were much larger.In a recently published survey of glaciers, scientists showed that the Patagonian icefields follow the global trend of ice melting and loss. Ice losses here have occurred because air temperatures have been increasing along the length of the Andes, even while there has been a small increase in precipitation (snow) that feeds the glaciers.Credit: NASA #NASA #NASAEarth #Earth #AndesMountains #Patagonia #IceField #Ice #IceAge #EarthViews #ISS #EarthPhotography",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CXcLEXjJWxB/,post_1184.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1uJguwWB2MsIkdr-Y5P5-ZW2jD35YghM0

LCRD will showcase the unique capabilities of optical communications which increases bandwidth for communicating data in space while reducing size, weight, and power requirements.Laser communications – also called optical communications because of the use of infrared light to send information – offers higher data rates than traditional radio frequency systems, enabling more data to be sent with each transmission. This new way of communicating with spacecraft could expand the possibilities of what we could learn from future missions across the solar system.Once operational in geosynchronous orbit – about 22,000 miles above Earth – LCRD will demonstrate space-to-ground laser communications linking ground stations in Hawaii and California. Later in its mission, LCRD will receive and transmit data from an optical terminal that we will place on the International Space Station (@ISS).You can learn more about the LCRD mission by tuning in to the new season of The Invisible Network podcast, wherever you get your podcasts.  Credit: NASA/ Joel Kowsky#NASA #Launch #LCRD #Lasers #SpaceTechnology #Space #Technology #Communication #NightPhotography #SciencePhotography",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CXMm0eSJt69/,post_1188.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=154xVi06Z5tNSWBSGitF6gd7BMrfqSf1R

Visible in the foreground is a Russian segment of the orbiting laboratory.A solar eclipse happens when the Moon moves between the Sun and Earth, casting a shadow on Earth, fully or partially blocking the Sun’s light in some areas. For a total solar eclipse to take place, the Sun, Moon, and Earth must line up exactly.A joint NASA-@NOAA observatory, DSCOVR orbits about a million miles from Earth and takes a new picture of Earth every two hours with its camera called EPIC – the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera. Launched in 2009, DSCOVR monitors changes in the solar wind and provides space weather forecasts and alerts for solar storms that could temporarily disrupt power grids and GPS.Credits: NASA/NOAA#TotalEclipse #SolarEclipse #Eclipse #Eclipse2021 #Sun #Moon #Earth #Space #Shadows #HappyEclipseFeet",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CXKQ86Dps0H/,post_1191.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wl1RjeQ6bLgWzAqo6pKtZjVU7MJnJQtq

A string of sunset planets, a chance to see 2021's brightest comet, and the annual Geminid meteor shower.⁣ ⁣ On December 6 through 10, look westward following sunset for the Moon visiting Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter in turn. The Moon's crescent fills out as it appears higher in the sky each evening over the course of the week. On December 12, recently-discovered comet Leonard will be at its closest to Earth, just a couple of weeks before it reaches its closest distance from the Sun. You'll probably need binoculars to spot it.⁣ ⁣ Finally, this year's Geminid meteor shower peaks overnight on December 13-14, and is best observed after the Moon sets.

"And now for something completely different...  During its 26th flight, the Ingenuity #MarsHelicopter—the first powered aircraft to fly on another world—spotted gear used by the Perseverance rover to survive its descent to the Martian surface. We've seen similar sights like this from orbit thanks to the HiRise camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, but this is the first time we've been able to survey the scene up close, and it can teach us a lot about the forces of landing on Mars.  In surveying both the parachute that helped Perseverance land on Mars and the cone-shaped backshell that protected the rover in deep space and during its fiery descent toward the surface of the planet, Ingenuity may provide valuable information that could benefit future landings on Mars.  Many of the 80 high-strength suspension lines connecting the backshell to the parachute are visible and appear intact. Spread out and covered in dust, only about a third of the orange-and-white parachute can be seen, but the canopy shows no signs of damage from the supersonic airflow experienced during its inflation. Look closely to spot the shadow cast by Ingenuity while it took the images.  Several weeks of analysis will be needed before a more final verdict can be issued on whether all of the landing support systems functioned as designed—but the results are sure to help guide the future of Martian landings.

"We're taking science in a new direction ⬆️  #IXPE, our Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer, lifted off from @NASAKennedy at 1:00 a.m. EST (06:00 UTC) this morning. Orbiting about 375 miles (600 km) above Earth's equator, IXPE will observe the universe using polarized X-rays, a unique property of light rarely studied in space. Polarized light occurs when light waves bounce off matter in particular ways, causing their electric fields to all vibrate in the same direction. (Polarized sunglasses, for example, work by blocking unpolarized light after it reflects off of water, reducing glare.)  Understanding polarized X-rays will help us unlock the secrets of our universe's most energetic objects, from how black holes spin to what keeps incredibly powerful pulsars running.

Astronomers suspect the white dwarf star was more massive than expected – heavier stars expel more gas – which also means it would have died earlier in its lifecycle. Credit: NASA, ESA, and Y.

"✨A thing of mystery and beauty. This complex nebula is filled with glowing gases, lanes of dust, and stars of all ages—but what interests astronomers the most is what ISN'T there. One of its most distinctive features is the dark, starry gap called a “superbubble,” visible in this @NASAHubble image in the upper central region. The hole is about 250 light-years wide and its presence is still something of a mystery. Stellar winds expelled by massive stars in the bubble's interior may have driven away the gas, but this is inconsistent with measured wind velocities in the bubble. Another possibility, since the nebula is filled with massive stars that would expire in titanic explosions, is that the expanding shells of old supernovae sculpted the cosmic cavern.   📲 Check out our Instagram story to screen shot this as your new wallpaper!  Credit: NASA, ESA, V.

Since Jupiter's orbit is outside Earth's, the planet always appears full to Earthbound humans.   Io and Europa seen on the right portion of this image are two of Jupiter's moons, and will soon get an up-close and personal look from our spacecraft Juno; Europa will be visited in September of this year and Io in late 2023 and early 2024. Despite Europa and Io being celestial cousins, the pair are disparate in their make-up; Io is our solar system's most volcanic body, while Europa's surface is covered in ice. Scientists believe that Europa is one of the most promising places in our solar system for an environment suitable for life outside of Earth.   Taken about 38,000 miles from the planet's surface (61,000 kilometers) by the Juno spacecraft, this image was compiled from the raw data of JunoCam by citizen scientist Andrea Luck.

"Spotted: signs of a potential planet about 28 million light-years away 🔎 🪐For the first time, astronomers may have detected an exoplanet candidate outside of the Milky Way galaxy. Exoplanets are defined as planets outside of our solar system. All other known exoplanets and exoplanet candidates have been found in the Milky Way, almost all of them less than about 3,000 light-years from Earth.This new result is based on transits, events in which the passage of a planet in front of a star blocks some of the star's light and produces a characteristic dip. Researchers used our @NASAChandraXray Observatory to search for dips in the brightness of X-rays received from X-ray bright binaries in the spiral galaxy Messier 51, also called the Whirlpool Galaxy (pictured here). These luminous systems typically contain a neutron star or black hole pulling in gas from a closely orbiting companion star. They estimate the exoplanet candidate would be roughly the size of Saturn, and orbit the neutron star or black hole at about twice the distance of Saturn from the Sun.This composite image of the Whirlpool Galaxy was made with X-ray data from Chandra and optical light from our @NASAHubble Space Telescope.Credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/SAO/R.

"I mean… 😍If you have a chance tonight, catch a glimpse of the full Moon. The nearly full Moon is seen here as it rises from The Observatory at America’s Square in Washington, DC on Oct. 19, 2021.  The full Moon after the Harvest Moon is known as the Hunter's Moon. The earliest use of the term ""Hunter's Moon"" cited in the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1710. According to the Farmer's Almanac, with the leaves falling and the deer fattened, it is time to hunt.The Maine Farmer's Almanac first published Native American names for the full Moons in the 1930s. Over time, these names have become widely known and used. According to this almanac, as the full Moon in October the Algonquin tribes in what is now the northeastern U.S. called this the Travel Moon, the Dying Grass Moon, or the Sanguine or Blood Moon. Some sources indicate that the Dying Grass, Sanguine, and Blood Moon names are related to the turning of the leaves and dying back of plants with the start of fall. Others indicate that the names Sanguine or Blood Moon are associated with hunting to prepare for winter.Credit: NASA/Aubrey Gemignani#NASA #FullMoon #HuntersMoon #Space #WashingtonDC #Moon #Photography #Astronomy",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CVQsIkqp6MA/,post_1235.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_nHnGPPVcE85lcv_lEg4c8U81WqtoHaR

"It takes two to tango 💃@NASAHubble captures the delicate dance between two interacting galaxies. Setting the scene at more than 100 million light-years away from Earth, the lower galaxy clearly tugs at the galaxy on the upper right, which appears to extend one spiral arm downward. The two galaxies are classified as spiral, but their shapes appear different due to their orientation in respect to Earth. Astronomers think that collisions between spiral galaxies like this can lead to the formation of another type of galaxy, known as elliptical galaxies. As extremely massive and energetic these collisions may be, it is no quickstep. Collisions like these often take place over hundreds of millions of years, so we should not expect this dancing pair to look any different during the course of our lifetimes. Credit: NASA/ @EuropeanSpaceAgency/ Hubble/ J.

"🎶 Spiderweave, Spiderweave, helps our heat shields overachieve 🕸️With the possibilities of future missions to Mars and beyond, scientists are finding new ways to make it safer for larger vehicles to safely pass the atmosphere of more distant locations. Our Adaptable, Deployable, Entry and Placement Technology, or ADEPT, is testing a next-generation heat shield design for delivering jumbo-size cargo to planetary surfaces.Meet: Spiderweave. The new 3D-woven carbon fabric can open up like an umbrella and withstand temperatures greater than 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit (about 1,650°C). Spiderweave uses a new design architecture where materials are continuously woven into the heat shield’s fabric, avoiding issues like points of increased stress and other rifts within the material. Where saving space and enabling safer atmospheric entries are top priorities, Spiderweave can be packed up at launch and stored in a compact space when sending science to other worlds.In this image, the ADEPT Spiderweave material is put to the test in the arc jet facilities at @NASAAmes, which simulates the intense heating spacecraft experience during atmospheric entry.Credit: NASA/Patrick Viruel #NASA #SpaceTechnology #SpaceTravel #SpideySenses",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CUYC_dnJRvG/,post_1250.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12yokESMfRCmbk_kZNWvzm--S9CTAzmTY

"✨ Maybe she's born with it, maybe it's dust bubbles and gas eruptions.Brilliant blue light-emitting stars are massive, rare and hot! Things heat up as the star begins to lose mass in the final stages of life, and stellar materials begin to fall inward.

These views demonstrate the dual nature of the Luminous Blue Variable star. The first image shows off details of ionized hydrogen and nitrogen emissions from the expanding shell of the nebula (seen here in red).

"Our changing planet through the eyes of #Landsat 🌎Since 1972, the NASA and @USGS Landsat Program has brought us an unprecedented and nearly continuous visual record of Earth’s landscapes, icescapes, and coastal waters. Landsat satellites have collected more than 9 million scenes and provoked more than 18,000 research papers. This false-color Landsat 8 image, voted as a favorite by visitors to our Earth Observatory website, shows wetlands around the Mississippi Delta on Dec. 1, 2016. The colors emphasize the difference between land and water while allowing viewers to observe waterborne sediment, which is typically absent from false-color imagery.In a 2017 study, researchers analyzed roughly 10,000 Landsat satellite images of this area, taken between 1982 and 2016. They found that winds are responsible for the widespread growth of ponds in three watersheds along the Mississippi River. In effect, the study showed that wind-driven erosion, which nibbles away coastlines and the edges of larger bodies of water, can also happen inland on small scales.We celebrate the legacy of the Landsat program, as we look forward to continuing its observations of our home planet with the upcoming launch of its newest satellite.

"Beautiful ends make new beginnings ✨  A glowing horseshoe-shaped cloud of gas is against a backdrop of thousands of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, observed here by @NASAChandraXray and @NASAHubble. The supernova remnant featured here was produced by the explosion of a massive star. The explosion sent shockwaves rumbling through interstellar space at speeds of several million miles per hour, which can create sudden, large changes in pressure and temperature behind the waves.   The X-ray glow, shown in blue, is the result of a shockwave heating interstellar gas to temperatures of about 10 million degrees. The horseshoe shape may be caused by uneven distribution of interstellar gas around the site of the explosion.

Our Galileo spacecraft took this false-color mosaic, constructed from a series of 53 images, as the spacecraft zoomed over the northern regions of our Moon on December 7, 1992. The spacecraft was on its way to Jupiter.  The mosaic helps us see variations in parts of the Moon's northern hemisphere. Bright pinkish areas are the lunar highlands, including the ones surrounding the oval lava-filled Crisium impact basin toward the bottom of the picture. Blue-to-orange shades indicate ancient volcanic lava flows.   To the left of Crisium is the dark blue Mare Tranquillitatis, where Apollo 11 landed. It’s richer in titanium than the green and orange areas above it. Thin mineral-rich soils associated with relatively recent meteorite or asteroid impacts are represented by light blue colors; the youngest craters have prominent blue rays extending from them.   The Galileo probe, named for the Italian astronomer who discovered Jupiter’s four largest moons, orbited the gas giant from 1995 to 2003. Its camera and nine other instruments helped scientists make numerous discoveries, including one that indicates the planet's icy moon Europa likely has a subsurface ocean.

"All of the lights 🌌A captivating display of light is captured from the International Space Station (@ISS) as it orbits 271 miles above the southern Indian Ocean in between Asia and Antarctica. Observing auroras – and discovering what causes them to change over time – gives researchers insight into how our planet's magnetosphere reacts to the space weather near Earth. The dancing lights of the aurora provide spectacular views from the ground, but can also give scientists valuable insights into the incoming energy and particles from the Sun. The Sun continuously produces a solar wind made of charged particles that flow outward into the solar system. When the solar wind reaches Earth’s magnetic field, it can cause magnetic reconnection, an explosive process that allows charged particles from space to accelerate into the atmosphere.  Earth’s tear-shaped magnetic field – called the magnetosphere – continuously responds to the changing intensity of the solar wind. The solar wind particles funnel around the long tail of the magnetosphere where they become trapped. As particles collide with atoms and molecules in Earth’s upper atmosphere, the interaction provides atoms with extra energy which is released as a burst of light. These interactions continue at lower and lower altitudes until all incoming energy is lost.  When we see the glowing aurora, we are watching billions of individual collisions light up the magnetic field lines of Earth. ✨ Credit: NASA #NASA #InternationalSpaceStation #SouthernLights #AuroraAustralis",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CSaF1LYp0dn/,post_1294.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1B9X26IGQgEuNDgXt3iZIyvE2QF7P3eRP

On June 5th, 2015, a burst of X-rays created high-energy rings within a system, a phenomenon known as light echoes. Similar to the way sound waves bounce off a canyon wall, light echoes are produced when a burst of x-rays from the black hole's system bounce off dust clouds between the system and Earth. Located 7,800 light-years away, this black hole actively pulls material away from a companion star into a disk around the invisible object.

"FLAME ON 🔥Humans have been playing with fire since the beginning of time – but fire takes a different form in microgravity. For one, in reduced gravity the flame looks a lot different from those seen here on Earth. The familiar shape we know is due to the way hot gasses from the flame rise while gravity pulls cooler denser air to the bottom of the flame. In microgravity, this flow doesn’t occur, creating spherical shaped flamesThis image displays a snapshot of a flame in microgravity. The yellow spots are soot clusters that glow yellow when hot – these grow larger in microgravity than on Earth because soot remains within the flame longer. The results of these experiments could enable the design of flames that are more-sooty or soot-free, depending on the need of a specific application – such as enhancing radiant heat or reducing pollutant production.This image is one of many flames ignited as part of the Flame Design investigation within the Combustion Integrated Rack, which was designed to safely conduct combustion experiments on the International Space Station (@ISS) without risk to the spacecraft or its crew.

The relative nearby galaxy cluster has lensed a significantly more distant inactive galaxy - which has run out of the gas to require to form new stars and is located 10 billion light-years away. 🔎Using this “natural magnifying glass” of sorts allows astronomers to inspect objects like distant dormant galaxies which would usually be too difficult to view even with Hubble. Credit: ESA/Hubble & NASA, A.

"What causes X-ray auroras on Jupiter? Ions ""surfing"" electromagnetic waves! ⚛️ 🌊⁣ ⁣ Jupiter has the most powerful auroras in the solar system, and is the only one of the four giant planets with an aurora that has been found to emit X-rays. Planetary astronomers knew the auroras are triggered by ions crashing into Jupiter’s atmosphere. Now, they have learned how the ions responsible for the X-ray light show are able to get to the atmosphere.⁣ ⁣ Scientists combined measurements taken by our Juno spacecraft with data from the @EuropeanSpaceAgency's XMM-Newton mission, to solve a 40-year-old mystery about the origins of Jupiter’s unusual X-ray auroras. For the first time, they have seen the entire mechanism at work: The electrically charged atoms, or ions, responsible for the X-rays are “surfing” electromagnetic waves in Jupiter’s magnetic field, down into the gas giant’s atmosphere.⁣ ⁣ The purple hues in this image show the X-ray emissions from Jupiter’s auroras, detected by our Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2007.

"📸 EXPLAINED: @NASAHubble’s iconic photos ✨We get the question a lot – how does Hubble take its images? Are the colors real? Today, we’re here to break it all down. 🤳 Unlike a cell phone camera, our space telescope doesn't take a snapshot and get the image back in color. Rather, its cameras take images over a broad range of wavelengths that come down to Earth in grayscale. Scientists create color images by taking exposures using different color filters on the telescope, assigning a color to each filter that corresponds to the wavelength of that filter, and combining the images. 👁️ Many full-color Hubble images are combinations of three separate exposures — one each taken in red, green, and blue light. When mixed together, these three colors can recreate almost any color of light that is visible to human eyes. That’s how televisions, computer monitors, and video cameras recreate colors to show a picture! Because we can’t see the colors in the Ultraviolet and Infrared spectrum, scientists use the closest approximation of them in the visible light spectrum to represent that information. 💫 Color in Hubble images is used to highlight interesting features of the celestial object being studied. Take this Ring Nebula for example! Shown here in visible light, the deep blue center represents helium, the cyan color of the inner ring is the glow of hydrogen and oxygen, and the reddish color of the outer ring is from nitrogen and sulfur. Credit: NASA, ESA, and the Hubble Heritage (STScI/AURA)-ESA/Hubble Collaboration#FunFacts #NowYouKnow #Hubble #NASA #PhotographyDaily #Cosmos",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CRhicuuppoE/,post_1316.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1vQm-z-wkUT2S2uVi8vl6XrIJCZ1bU10o

"A name fit for a sci-fi thriller: Supermassive Black Hole Tsunami 🎬Astrophysicists have used computer simulations to show deep in space the gas escaping the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole may form tsunami-like structures. Just within the distance where the supermassive black hole loses its grip on the surrounding matter, the relatively cool atmosphere of the spinning disk can form waves, similar to the surface of the ocean. When interacting with HOT winds (which can be 10x hotter than the sun) these waves can steepen into spiraling vortex structures that can reach a height of 10 light-years above the disk. This illustration shows a supermassive black hole veiled in dust, and strange features in nearby gas. High-energy X-rays from the disk surrounding the black hole interact with this gas and give rise to two unusual features: Tsunamis (light blue ""waves"" above disk) and a Kármán vortex street (orange).Stronger evidence may come from future missions, but until then, the researchers will continue improving their models and comparing them with available data, caught in the whirlwind of this mystery. Illustration Credit: Nima Abkenar#NASA #Tsunami #Blackhole #Mystery #SciFi #Science",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ4n9qGpKIo/,post_1335.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1iNFWgxGYLbGpgxzwPGeb9Y6pcAuwVUCx

This was part of the largest survey of star formation ever conducted in X-rays, covering some 24,000 individual stars in 40 different regions. The study outlines the link between the powerful flares or outbursts from young stars and the impact they could have on planets in orbit around them. The give and take of mega flares:Over the past 20 years, scientists have argued that these giant flares can help ""give"" planets to still-forming stars by driving gas away from disks of material that surround them. This can trigger the formation of pebbles and other small rocky material that is a crucial step for planets to form. On the other hand, these flares may ""take away"" from planets that have already formed by blasting any atmospheres with powerful radiation, possibly resulting in their complete evaporation and destruction. Credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/Penn State/K.

"Glue – but make it galactic-grade! 💫Most galaxies rotate so fast that gravity generated by gas and stars alone is not enough to keep them together. Dark matter is thought to be the invisible glue that holds these galaxies together – making up the bulk of the universe’s matter.When researchers found a galaxy lacking the invisible stuff – it would have the potential to upset theories of galaxy formation and evolution. With observations collected by @NASAHubble, astronomers found that this ghostly galaxy doesn’t appear to have a central region, spiral arms, or a disk – and contains about 1/400 of the amount of dark matter expected by astronomers.Sitting almost as wide as the Milky Way galaxy and about 72 million light-years away, this oddball galaxy contains only 1/200 of the number of stars as our galaxy. The observed number of stars accounts for most of the galaxy's gravity.Credits: NASA, @EuropeanSpaceAgency, STScI, Zili Shen (Yale), Pieter van Dokkum (Yale), Shany Danieli (IAS) IMAGE PROCESSING: Alyssa Pagan (STScI)#NASA #HubbleTelescope #Glueless #Galaxy",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CQeORFFpVeK/,post_1343.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1eZPcfBlBF-AqHAbvOJ5XzbUJjkeYx2BT

"Super Flower Blood Moon Lunar Eclipse!!! Say that 20 times fast!!! 💨 Early risers rejoice! Watch one of the sky’s most spectacular shows happening Wednesday, May 26, when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align, creating a total lunar eclipse. This will be the first total lunar eclipse in more than two years. You don't need special glasses or gizmos to view it, unlike a solar eclipse, so feel free to stare directly at the Moon. Binoculars or a telescope will improve the view!But first, let’s get some clarity, shall we?…💥 Why is it “super”?Did you know that the shape of the Moon’s orbit around the Earth isn’t a perfect circle, but an oval? When a full Moon reaches the point closest to Earth on its elliptical orbit, it’s called a supermoon!🌼 Why is it “flower”?The name is a reference to the flowers that bloom in May.🩸 Why is it “blood”?The Moon will appear blood red as it aligns with the Sun and Earth and passes fully into Earth’s shadow, or umbra. The Moon’s red hue is caused by red-orange light refracted through Earth’s atmosphere and can appear even redder if there are lots of clouds or dust.👀 Skywatchers, where will you be watching from? Tag us in your favorite picture you’ve taken of our beautiful Moon! We’ll be keeping an eye out to share a few in our Instagram Story!The total lunar eclipse will begin at 4:47am ET (08:47 UTC) and end at 9:50am ET (13:50 UTC), with peak totality — the ""blood moon"" stage — occurring at 7:16am ET (11:16 UTC).

"Light colors? For summer? Groundbreaking.  Many of us pick out an outfit based on the day’s weather – sunnier days may call for lighter colors and fabrics to stay cool.   The reason behind this is that visible light reflects off light colors and is absorbed by darker colors. The reflectivity, called albedo, is a key way the Earth regulates its temperature. But this is not always the case for all solar energy wavelengths. In the near-infrared part of the spectrum, surfaces like ice and snow are not reflective – in fact, they absorb near-infrared light in much the same way a dark T-shirt absorbs visible light.  “People think snow is reflective. It’s so shiny,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of @NASAGoddard Institute for Space Studies and acting NASA senior climate adviser. “But it turns out in the near-infrared part of the spectrum, it’s almost black.”  Using the vantage point of the International Space Station (@ISS), climate scientists are learning more about how solar energy interact with Earth’s surface and systems – at all wavelengths. This is one of the ways researchers are hoping to better inform models of the present and future climate.

"We’re blown away! 🤯A recent discovery made with @NASAChandraXRay could be a major step in pinpointing exactly how some giant stars explode. Located in our galaxy about 11,000 light-years away from Earth, is one of the youngest known supernova remnants called Cassiopeia A, with an age of about 350 years. Scientists have found fragments of titanium (blue hues) blasting out of this famous supernova – which strongly supports the idea of a neutrino-driven explosion to explain some at least some supernovae.Recent 3D computer simulations suggest that these neutrinos – or very low-mass subatomic particles – made in the creation of the neutron star play a crucial role in driving bubbles that speed away from the neutron star. These bubbles continue driving the shock wave forward to trigger the supernova explosion.Picture this: The amount of stable titanium produced in Cas A exceeds the total mass of the Earth. Image credit: NASA/CXC/RIKEN/T.

"Weathering the 2021 hurricane season 🌀  Today marks the first day of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. Here at NASA, we’re developing new technology to help study storm formation and impact. Here’s five fast facts how:   1️⃣ Viewing storms from space In addition to the vantage point of space, satellites can capture other wavelengths of light, such as infrared, which can help identify features our eyes can’t on their own.  2️⃣ Satellites can see inside hurricanes in 3D By looking inside a hurricane, scientists can help understand how the storm is changing by studying the precipitation structure of the storm over time and monitor the risk of severe flooding.  3️⃣ Understanding climate change’s effect on storm behavior More storms are increasing in strength quickly, a process called rapid intensification, where hurricane wind speeds increase by 35 mph (or more) in just 24 hours.   4️⃣ Monitoring the damage done by hurricanes Measurements from the ground, the air, and space can give researchers insights into the way these storms reshape natural habitats and communities.  5️⃣ Helping communities prepare for storms and respond to the aftermath The data collected is available for free to the public, which regional and local governments use to prepare for and understand the impacts of these disasters.  Working together with partners such as @NOAA and @FEMA, NASA is ready to help communities weather another year of storms.

Once it arrived, the SLS core stage was offloaded and moved to Kennedy’s Vehicle Assembly Building, where it will be prepared for integration atop the mobile launcher with the completed stack of solid rocket boosters ahead of the Artemis I launch.

Astronomers theorize that hydrogen from the original atmosphere was absorbed into the planet’s molten magma mantle and is now being slowly released by volcanism to form a new atmosphere. The second atmosphere, which continues to leak away into space, is continually being replenished from the reservoir of hydrogen in the mantle’s hot magma.The findings could have implications for other exoplanets, planets beyond our solar system!🌋 What do you think is keeping the mantle hot enough to remain liquid and power volcanism on the planet?

"Did Juno❓  Did you know that Jupiter has a turbulent atmosphere? This view of the face of Jupiter from our Juno spacecraft includes several of the planet’s southern jet streams. Using data from Juno’s instruments, scientists discovered that the planet’s powerful atmospheric jet streams extend far deeper than previously imagined. Evidence from Juno also shows that the jet streams and belts penetrate about 1,800 miles (3,000 kilometers) down into the planet.   The storm known as the Great Red Spot is also visible here on the horizon, nearly rotated out of view as Juno sped away from Jupiter at about 30 miles per second (48 kilometers per second), which is more than 100,000 mph (160,900 kilometers per hour). It is a centuries-old storm bigger than Earth! 🌎  Credit: NASA/@NASAJPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS Image processing: Tanya Oleksuik © CC NC SA  #NASA #Jupiter #Juno #Galaxy #GreatRedSpot #Astronomy #SolarSystem #JunoCam",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CLILUrWJ2d5/,post_1452.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1TlElQuxuw3fjd6v_oLmUer1WkCg7lcVK

"🌌 Cosmic blinding lightsCaldwell 99 also known as the Coalsack is a dark nebula located within the constellation Crux, easily visible to the naked eye as a dark patch silhouetted against the southern Milky Way. Having been viewed by stargazers in the Southern Hemisphere for millennia, Caldwell 99 has no discoverer, but Europeans first learned of it from Spanish explorer Vicente Yáñez Pinzón in 1499. Caldwell 99 is located approximately 600 light-years from Earth and is about 100 light-years across. The dust in this nebula absorbs and scatters the light from background stars, making many of them appear fainter and redder.

"🏞️Park and preserve West Virginia has rolling green hills, soaring mountains, and diverse wildlife, but until late in 2020, it did not have a national park. Though it was home to some rivers and historic sites managed by the @NationalParkService, it did not have a full-fledged “park”—large areas of land that protect an array of natural and historic features. This changed in December 2020 when the United States Congress passed a bill designating the New River Gorge as a national park and preserve.The image above shows the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve in southern West Virginia, which is a little under 60 miles away from American mathematician Katherine Johnson's birthplace in White Sulphur Springs. Johnson was first hired in the aeronautics industry as a “computer” in 1952.

"🤯 Discovery alert: We don’t know of many planets quite like this!Thanks to data from our @NASAGoddard TESS mission, a planet existing around THREE stars has been confirmed, after a hefty hunt that spanned about 11 years! It all started shortly after NASA's Kepler mission began operations in 2009, when it identified what was thought to be a planet about the size of Neptune later known as KOI-5Ab. The planet which was the second new planet candidate to be found by the mission, was ultimately forgotten as Kepler racked up planet discoveries. Now, the chief scientist of NASA’s Exoplanet Science Institute says he has “resurrected KOI-5Ab from the dead!"" and we are so glad he did. Planet KOI-5Ab (shown here transiting across the face of a sun-like star), is located 1,800 light-years away in the Cygnus constellation. It is about one half the mass of Saturn & orbits a star (star A) with a relatively close companion (star B). Star A and star B orbit each other every 30 years. A third gravitationally bound star (star C) orbits stars A and B every 400 years.Illustration Credits: Caltech/R.

"🔵From Florida to Pluto to the Kuiper Belt and beyond!Exactly 15 years ago today, an uncrewed NASA spacecraft by the name of New Horizons blasted off on a 3 billion-mile journey to Pluto from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station by an @ULALaunch Atlas rocket at a speed of about 36,400 mph (16.26 km/s). It was the fastest human-made object EVER launched from Earth.By launching in 2006, New Horizons was able to take advantage of an assist from Jupiter. The Pluto probe approached a rendezvous with Jupiter and used the giant planet as a gravity-based slingshot. The five-month flyby induced a colossal burst of speed, accelerating the spacecraft by 9000 mph up to 52,000 mph. At that wild speed, you could soar from Los Angeles to New York in less than 4 minutes!After passing through the Pluto system in 2015, the spacecraft retargeted itself for an encounter with a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) called Arrokoth, a Native American term meaning “sky” in the Powhatan/Agonquian language. While there, the spacecraft gathered data that researchers believe could contribute to our understanding of the origin of life on Earth.Credit: 🔵NASA🔵NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI🔵NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute/Roman Tkachenko#NASA #Pluto #PlutoFlyBy #Space #Galaxy #Universe #Exploration",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CKPpGARJA18/,post_1480.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13_LXbkAnOtx7hlvIOz7CAxkPs026ND0o

They are one effect of such energetic particles, which can speed out from the Sun both in a steady stream called the solar wind or from giant eruptions known as coronal mass ejections or CMEs. After a trip toward Earth that can last three days, the solar particles and magnetic fields cause the release of particles already trapped near Earth, which in turn trigger reactions in the upper atmosphere in which oxygen and nitrogen molecules release photons of light.

Infant stars appear as pink and red specks toward the center and appear to have formed in regularly spaced intervals that resemble the pattern of a snowflake.

"Storms, they are a-brewin'🌪Astronomers using the @NASAHubble Space Telescope watched a wild and mysterious dark vortex on Neptune abruptly steer away from a likely death on the giant blue-green planet. The storm, which is wider than the Atlantic Ocean (that’s approximately 4,600 miles across), was first discovered in the planet’s northern hemisphere by Hubble in 2018. To the surprise of astronomers, Hubble spotted the vortex change direction in August 2020, doubling back to the north. Though Hubble has tracked similar dark spots over the past 30 years, this unpredictable atmospheric behavior is something new to see!Astronomers are excited about the findings because it is potentially part of the dark spot’s disruption process, which has never been observed. Dark spots often faded away and then disappeared, but  astronomers have never seen a storm on another planet make a sudden U-turn and drift back northward.Credits: NASA, ESA, STScI, M.H.

"Stellar Babies!  This is where stars are born.   @NASAHubble snapped this image of a special class of star-forming nursery known as Free-floating Evaporating Gaseous Globules, or frEGGs for short. This object is formally known as J025157.5+600606.  When a massive new star starts to shine while still within the cool molecular gas cloud from which it formed, its energetic radiation can ionize the cloud’s hydrogen and create a large, hot bubble of ionized gas. Amazingly, located within this bubble of hot gas around a nearby massive star are the frEGGs: dark compact globules of dust and gas, some of which are giving birth to low-mass stars. The boundary between the cool, dusty frEGG and the hot gas bubble is seen as the glowing purple/blue edges in this fascinating image.  Credit: ESA/Hubble & NASA, R.

"Looking for a dramatic story? 👀You might want to redirect your attention from Hollywood’s stars to the real thing. From birth to death, these burning spheres of gas experience some of the most extreme conditions our cosmos has to offer.All stars are born in clouds of dust and gas. In these stellar nurseries, clumps of gas form, pulling in more and more mass as time passes. As they grow, these clumps start to spin and heat up. Once they get heavy and hot enough (like, 27 million degrees Fahrenheit or 15 million degrees Celsius), nuclear fusion starts in their cores. This process occurs when protons, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms, squish together to form helium nuclei. This releases a lot of energy, which heats the star and pushes against the force of its gravity. A star is born.Credit: NASA/@NASASolarSystem#Stars #Dramatic #SayWhat #NASA #Astronomy #StarSuff",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CFXxjAvJiIE/,post_1551.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jolyAqrqPUPIKOpwsGi2QBN7duyiEaKG

And while the controls of the T-38 aren't the same as a spacecraft, astronauts say the need to think quickly in changing situations and carefully follow procedures is critical preparation for spaceflight and spacewalks.Credit: NASA/Jonny Kim#NationalAviationDay #aviation #t38 #pilot #astronauts #nasa",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/CEFYwDypDMu/,post_1572.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LSM8FlLN_Cp_WOJNkhj_pLh64icoRmrh

Home to a thousand or so young stars, it will be a subject of study for our @NASAWebb Telescope scheduled to launch in 2021. ⁣ ⁣ A team of Webb scientists will study an inner region of the nebula called the Trapezium Cluster. First, they will survey the distribution of the masses of young objects in this cluster. Next, they will examine the very earliest phases of planet formation around the cluster’s young stars.

"Each year, Saturn's moon Titan drifts a little farther away from its planet. ⁣ ⁣ How far does it drift? About 4 inches (11 cm) per year. As a moon orbits, its gravity pulls on the planet, causing a temporary bulge in the planet as it passes.⁣ Over time, the energy created transfers from the planet to the moon, nudging it farther and farther out. ⁣ The discovery was made using data from our @NASASolarSystem Cassini mission to Saturn, which ended in 2017. While scientists know that Saturn formed 4.6 billion years ago in the early days of the solar system, there's more uncertainty about when the planet's rings and its system of more than 80 moons formed. ⁣ ⁣ The revised rate of its drift suggests that the moon started out much closer to Saturn, which would mean the whole system expanded more quickly than previously believed.

The red and blue bands on either side of the image represent two different wavelengths of light; the gray area shows both wavelengths. ⁣ ⁣ This nebula is located about 1,000 light-years from Earth. The visible light comes from gas in the nebula being heated by a nearby, extremely massive star known as Xi Persei, or Menkib.

"""Houston, we've had a problem.""⁣ ⁣ It was a mission burdened with problems from the beginning. But failure was not an option. Today marks the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 13 mission’s oxygen tank explosion which derailed the nation’s third attempt to land on the Moon.⁣ ⁣ The explosion nearly left astronauts Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise stranded in space. Fighting to keep their spacecraft alive, they raced against the clock alongside Mission Control. To save power, the crew shut down several critical systems -- including heat. Quickly, their Apollo spacecraft became an igloo. Water condensed onto the computer displays and switches. Toxic levels of carbon dioxide filled the spacecraft cabin. Thankfully, ingenuity, teamwork and cool heads brought the crew home to a safe splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on April 18, 1970. What could have been a tale of tragedy turned into a tale of triumph. ⁣ ⁣ We remember the lessons of Apollo 13 as we prepare our return to the Moon under our #Artemis program.

Rather than behaving like rigid structures, spiral arms—regions of stars that extend from the center of spiral galaxy—are in fact areas of greater density in a galaxy’s disk, with dynamics similar to those of a traffic jam. The density of cars moving through a traffic jam increases at the center of the jam, where they move more slowly. Spiral arms function in a similar way; as gas and dust move through areas of greater density, they become compressed and linger before moving out of them again.

"Put an ice ring on it 💍⁣ ⁣ For several decades, scientists and astronauts observing Lake Baikal have noticed giant rings in the spring ice on one of the world’s oldest and deepest lakes. ⁣ ⁣ While the rings have attracted speculation and a few conspiracy theories, decades of satellite data and field-based studies have shed light on why they form. Warm eddies of water circulate in a clockwise direction under the ice cover. The ice melts near the eddy boundary, but not at the eddy center where the currents are weak. The research team is still investigating what causes the eddies, but data suggests that they typically get going in autumn, before ice has covered the lake.⁣ ⁣ Image Credit: Lauren Dauphin, using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey and MODIS data from NASA EOSDIS/LANCE and GIBS/Worldview.⁣ ⁣ #NASA #Earth #Ice",nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8M5hm_FJgG/,post_1715.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HR6X8r2mYQSbghfQ-BL5DOlB6DbbirHj

"The frozen surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus 🥶 ⁣ ⁣ Enceladus' bright white coating of ice may look similar to where you live this time of year. It may be similar to Earth in other ways — though only about 310 miles (500 km) across, it is thought to have a very active world of liquid salty water, simple organic materials, and hydrothermal vents in a vast ocean beneath its crust. So active, in fact, that a plume of icy material continuously spews from the “tiger stripes” (fractures in the crust) on its South Pole hundreds of miles into space, even contributing to forming one of Saturn’s outer, icy rings.⁣ ⁣ This image was taken in 2015 on a flyby from our now-completed #Cassini mission, from which scientists are still analyzing data today.

"⭐ ➡️💥 A Chandra supernova in the sky... This Chandra X-ray Observatory (@nasachandraxray) image captures a star in the constellation Cassiopeia that was obliterated by an explosion. What's left behind is this multicolored, three-dimensional object: a supernova remnant. ⁣ ⁣ Tycho's supernova remnant — named for Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, among the first to spot it in 1572 — was a Type Ia, which occurs when a white dwarf star pulls material from, or merges with, a nearby companion star until a violent explosion is triggered, sending debris hurtling into space.⁣ ⁣ The image is providing clues to what caused the remnant's intriguing pattern of bright clumps and fainter areas. To emphasize the clumps in the image and the three-dimensional nature of Tycho, scientists selected two narrow ranges of X-ray energies to isolate material (silicon, colored red) moving away from Earth, and moving towards us (also silicon, colored blue). The other colors in the image (yellow, green, blue-green, orange and purple) show a broad range of different energies and elements, and a mixture of directions of motion. ⁣ Image Credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/RIKEN & GSFC/T.

"No, this isn’t a firework. 🎆 You are looking at a flame and the glowing soot clusters it produced aboard the International Space Station (@ISS). These yellow soot clusters grow larger than those on Earth, because they stay inside the flame longer in microgravity.  This flame was one of many ignited inside a combustion research facility to investigate the amount of soot that is produced in different conditions. Soot is the carbon residue left behind when organic matter (or other carbon-containing material) doesn’t fully burn. It causes environmental and health issues, but can be helpful in multiple ways, including by enhancing radiant heat.  This experiment could allow the design of flames that are more sooty or soot-free. These results may help create burner designs which are more efficient and less polluting.
