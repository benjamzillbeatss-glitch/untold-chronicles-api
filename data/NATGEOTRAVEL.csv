"Photos by Rubén Salgado Escudero (@rubensalgadoescudero) | Being on assignment in Costa Rica gave me a glimpse into the Ticos’ approach to life—Pura Vida. More than just a saying, it’s a way of connecting with others, of not letting life’s challenges weigh more than they should, and of honoring the incredible natural richness this country has to offer.  1. I came across these two White-Faced Capuchins grooming each other—their striking white face makes them one of Costa Rica’s most recognizable monkeys. The one being groomed looked directly at me in a trance-like state of relaxation. This is their way of establishing connection with each other and reducing stress, not so different from us. I often saw these playful creatures leaping through the trees, surrounded by the sounds and movement of countless other species that call this forest home.  2. I’d never been much of a coffee drinker, but I left Costa Rica with a newfound appreciation for what is a favorite daily ritual for many. When I met Manuel, the 4th generation farmer on the family-run coffee plantation, Aquiares, he spoke passionately about what coffee means to his community—the love, dedication, and precision that go into every step of its production. In Costa Rica, coffee is clearly much more than a drink; it’s a ritual to be savored as fully as life itself. Pura Vida!  3. I watched this Yellow-throated Toucan—also known as the Chestnut-mandibled Toucan, the largest in Costa Rica—feast on fruit from a palm tree at the Osa Conservation Center. The incredible diversity of wildlife here truly blew me away. Everywhere I turned, there seemed to be a new species moving through this lush, living paradise. | Pura vida awaits. 🌿 Explore lush rainforests, majestic volcanoes, and sun-kissed beaches.

"For more than a century, safaris have been shaped by outsiders.  The safari industry began in the late 19th century, during the colonial era, when European explorers and American adventurers traveled to the interiors of East and Southern Africa for cartography and game hunting. To this day, many safari lodges and camps are primarily owned by white male individuals, mainly serving white, affluent international travelers.   A small but growing group of African entrepreneurs is working to change that—redefining who benefits from Africa’s wildlife and reshaping the future of safaris.

"My first day in the Southern Pantanal, I thought I had stepped out of reality and into nature’s coloring book. Vivacious skies, rainbow-themed birds, and a massive cast of wildlife characters. “This is a photographer’s dream” was the thought that played on repeat. The trumpet trees had just come into bloom, so everywhere I looked, there was a unique image waiting to be made.  As striking as the landscape and its complementary characters were, it was the jaguar that remained my main attraction. And my first sighting couldn’t have been more memorable. A beautiful female and her cub rewarded my patience with an entire morning of intimate behavior. Grooming, playing, resting in the open shade just meters from our Oncafari vehicle. The mother glanced at us occasionally, calm and unbothered, while the cub explored the world around us.  Beyond the wildlife, it was also the human characters and their culture that pierced my soul. Smiling faces, non-stop joking, and great Brazilian vibes awaited me before and after every workday. It’s rare that I get to experience such a strong culture from both humans and animals on an assignment. This was one of those experiences that reminded me why I fell in love with photography in the first place. | The Pantanal: Jaguar sightings, stunning wetlands, and rich Pantaneiro traditions—Brazil’s Pantanal is calling.

"“When you do it with love, nature gives you double.” These are the wise words from my guide, Branco, in the Northern Pantanal. This is the land of the jaguar. It’s untamed, unpredictable, and unapologetically wild, a place where silence is broken by the call of a roaring big cat or the splash of a kingfisher. For a soul longing to connect with its biological roots, this is Brazil’s river of life.  My whole life, I waited to come back home and explore what it means to be Brazilian. I’ve traversed the globe chasing stories, seeking out the raw and the real, but coming here felt different. In the Northern Pantanal, the animals are in charge and that feels like home. No two days are the same, and each wildlife encounter is something to write home about. I could barely ease the tension on my shutter finger as each bend in the river revealed one of nature’s secrets.  Here, nature doesn’t just show up, it shows off. It’s vibrant, abundant, and world-class. And if you show up with love, it rewards you, double. | The Pantanal: Jaguar sightings, stunning wetlands, and rich Pantaneiro traditions—Brazil’s Pantanal is calling.

"Photos by Aaron Huey @argonautphoto | Seattle has been my home for 20 years, and I’m still surprised by how fast you can go from city streets to tide pools, from express lanes to towering trees. I recently spent a few days revisiting the places that pull me back to them, the places that slow me down and wake me up when I need to step away from a life with so many screens.  1. At Kubota Garden, you can wander the hidden Necklace of Ponds, where spring brings a kaleidoscope of flowers that makes it hard to leave. 2. Seward Park, another south-end favorite of mine, offers winding trails beneath old-growth cedars, where the air shifts and time slows enough for you to hear a symphony of birdsong. It’s just a few miles from downtown but quiet enough to forget where you are. 3. In West Seattle, you can kayak straight into a postcard of the skyline while watching the city unfold with every stroke of your paddle.  4. At Alki, with its small-town feel, be sure to walk the beaches, where driftwood lines the shore and a lighthouse keeps watch at the point. 5. And at Golden Gardens in Ballard, sunsets over the Cascades, more often than not, come with a show of seals surfacing just feet from the shore, all within view of campfires and picnics in the sand. These places aren’t far. But they feel as if they are. And sometimes that’s enough.   See more of Aaron’s photos at the link in bio. | Discover Seattle: Mother Nature’s City.

"Photo by @paoloverzone | Over the years, I’ve had the chance to visit Greece many times. Still, during my most recent journey, I truly discovered the awe-inspiring landscape of Meteora, nestled in the region of Thessaly. This surreal and magical formation of towering rock columns dates back more than 65 million years, shaped by ancient geological forces and gradual erosion.  Wandering through Meteora today is like stepping into a suspended space where nature, history, and spirituality are connected. From the ninth century onward, hermit monks sought refuge in the cliffs, drawn by the promise of isolation and introspection. Their presence slowly evolved into a more structured monastic community. By the 16th century, Meteora had become a thriving spiritual hub, with 24 monasteries perched among the cliffs, marking a golden age of Orthodox monastic life. Six sites remain active today. Four are inhabited by monks, while the remaining two serve as convents for nuns, with about 67 residents in total.  Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site, Meteora is a marvel of natural history and a profound emblem of faith, perseverance, and cultural legacy in Greece.

"Photo by @nicholesobecki | The nature of sand, which behaves at times like a liquid, at times like a gas, and at times like a solid, has long intrigued scientists and engineers. Until visiting the monoliths of Abu Dhabi’s fossil dunes, though, I had never seen it settle into anything like these abstract waves, seemingly frozen in time. Nature’s finest sculptures, they were created by cycles of ice ages and thaws that occurred millions of years ago. The geological relics likely took thousands of years to form—though the wind erosion that gave them their fantastic shapes will eventually wear them back down to more subdued forms. They are impermanent and unlikely, a calling card from our deep past. | From the known to the unknown, discover Abu Dhabi at your own pace: @VisitAbuDhabi",natgeotravel,https://www.instagram.com/p/DMsirUAMZLJ/,post_224.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Xwvt2uwE8NbnLo5tQzaM-_EEDcpVcU02

"Photos by @MichaelGeorge | In what I affectionately call my Groundhog Day project, I spent almost two weeks in San Diego’s Balboa Park to document everything that happens there. The park is massive, covering over 1,200 acres of land, and features gardens, museums, theaters, and the world-famous San Diego Zoo. These images show a range of the landscapes that can be found within the park, including a large plaza that's often lined with food trucks, unfathomably big fig trees, the Japanese Friendship Garden, various sculptures, and the San Diego Natural History Museum. When I first arrived, I thought it would be impossible to find something new after more than a week in the same park. Then, on my last day, to my delight I saw a group of live action role players in full suits of armor practicing their sword fighting.

What looked at first to be an easy task turned out to be a demanding and time-consuming effort. The Rembrandt is a tall ship, a traditionally rigged sailing vessel, which means all the sails have to be lifted manually, without electrical winches. Once the sails were up, the challenge was to board a Zodiac while the ship was moving and hope for a bit of breeze, so that the sails are nicely rounded, and for some photogenic icebergs both in the foreground and background. After an hour or so of bouncing around in the Zodiac feeling dizzy and seasick, it all came together!

"Video by @jodymacdonaldphoto | High above the Kathmandu Valley, the Swayambhunath Stupa keeps a watchful eye—literally. Its all-seeing eyes cast outward in every direction, watching, remembering. Locally it's known as the Monkey Temple, and for good reason. The sacred stillness is often interrupted by mischievous monkeys swinging through the ancient courtyards. Pilgrims circle the stupa in clockwise meditation, while the monkeys try to steal both snacks and serenity.  Believed to have emerged spontaneously from a lotus bloom, this 2,000-year-old shrine is one of Nepal’s oldest and arguably one of its most alive. Prayer flags whip in the wind. Butter lamps flicker. Life, death, and rebirth all swirl together here.  I’ve stood here many times, but never without pausing to think about what these painted eyes have witnessed. Empires rising and crumbling. Kings and rebels. Monks and misfits. So many stories that never made it into the history books.  My favorite time to visit is at sunset, when the gold around the stupa catches the last light of the day. For a few fleeting minutes, it doesn’t just shine; it glows. The chaos softens. The valley quiets, and in that stillness, it feels like the stupa is reminding me that while everything changes, something here is still watching.

"#AD  Photos by @Jonathan_Irish | To escape and refresh from the bustle of Tokyo, I traveled to nearby Hakone to practice Zazen meditation, soak in a traditional hot spring, and gaze upon (and capture) the iconic Mount Fuji. It was a perfect break from the city! 1) The views of majestic Mount Fuji from atop Mount Taikan, located in the town of Hakone, are some of the best you can see. I was fortunate that the fog lifted on this often shy mountain, and I could make a lifelong dream of seeing it a reality. 2) Traditional teahouses along the pilgrimage route to Edo (Tokyo’s former name) were often smoke-filled houses that welcomed travelers inside. The central fire was used to warm the entire house, and warm teas and hearty snacks were offered, a welcome respite from an arduous journey on foot. 3) Japanese teamaking, known as Sado or “the way of the tea,” is considered a meditative practice. A warm cup of amazake tea, with a healthy mochi rice cake, would have warmed travelers (just as it warmed me) on their way to Tokyo.  4) Surrounded by lush greenery and forest, Fukuzumiro in Hakone is a serene onsen, which means “hot spring” in Japanese. The big windows, roaring river nearby, and green forest make one feel very relaxed while still enjoying the warmth and comfort of the indoors.  5) A private onsen experience is not to be missed in Hakone. I spent about 45 minutes soaking in this natural hot spring, surrounded by the forest, and I’ve rarely felt as relaxed as I did after this soak. 6) Jyosen-ji, in Hakone, is a Soto Zen Buddhist temple originally founded in 1583. Today you can practice Zazen meditation with the monk, Orihashi-san. I spent 20 minutes meditating, under his direction, in silence, and it was a profound experience. Orihashi-san, captured here, is a quiet and very welcoming monk who is also an excellent chef!

The sprawling Vat Phou temple complex, with its lotus-filled reservoirs and carved stone pillars, bears a striking resemblance to Angkor Wat. The Laos temple differs from its famous Cambodian counterpart in at least one key way—it’s far quieter, with fewer crowds to contend with.

Go swimming and boating in Maine’s popular lakes or along its storied coastline, and then cap off the day by eating some of its famous lobster. Experience the solitude of the forest by hiking the 100-Mile Wilderness, one of the Appalachian Trail’s most remote sections, and bunk down in a treehouse, a lighthouse, or a quaint cottage overlooking the beach.

"#AD  Photos by @Jonathan_Irish | Japan has a tradition of expert craftsmanship. My recent Tokyo photo assignment allowed me to explore this culture of craft through visits to a museum dedicated to the art of bonsai, an upscale coffee tasting experience, and learning centuries-old woodblock printing techniques. 1) With over 1,000 bonsai trees on display, Tokyo’s Shunkaen Bonsai Museum is perhaps one of the most tranquil places to see these incredible trees. 2) Kobayashi-san, a bonsai master, expertly trims a bonsai tree that is hundreds of years old. Bonsai is the art of cultivating and shaping miniature trees into beautiful forms, and Kobayashi-san has been practicing for decades. 3) At Koffee Mameya Kakeru, one can opt for a regular coffee drink or try a coffee omakase, which is what I did. Omakase, which translates to ""I'll leave it up to you"" in Japanese, is an experience where you entrust the chef to select and prepare a multicourse event. Here, that concept is translated into expertly crafted coffee paired with delectable appetizers.  4) Heart-shaped foam is one of the treats you’ll see when enjoying one of Koffee Mameya Kakeru’s delicious drinks. 5) I came to Yukiko Takahashi, a sixth-generation owner of the studio, to learn the art of Edo-period, or ukiyo-e, woodblock printing. Dating back to the 17th century, this technique has been perfected over generations, with the 160-year-old Takahashi family business continuing the tradition. I was honored to learn about this beautiful art form from Takahashi-san. 6) Woodblock prints are made by pressing paper onto uniquely engraved blocks of wood layered with ink, each representing a different color or element of the final print. Under Takahashi-san’s eye, I created the displayed version of Katsushika Hokusai’s “The Great Wave,” one of the best-known woodblock prints. For an amateur, I was quite proud of the result!

"Within the next decade, China hopes to become a global leader in protected nature reserves, creating a network of wilderness that would be three times the size of the U.S. system.  Although China only created its first national park four years ago—it claims that by 2035 it will have 49 parks covering 272 million acres. China has already opened five national parks, totaling 57 million acres. Collectively, the parks span alpine peaks, tropical rainforests, remote glaciers, vast deserts, and high-altitude wetlands. They also protect rare animals like the giant panda, Siberian tiger, and Asian elephant.   While domestic tourists flock to China’s wilderness destinations, few foreigners follow suit. Instead, most international visitors focus on China’s giant, historic cities, like Beijing, Shanghai, and Xi’an. But that could change as China expands its park system.

"#AD  Photos by @Jonathan_Irish | Tokyo markets are a hub of activity, food, and cultural expression. On a recent photo assignment to this vibrant city, I had so much fun exploring the markets in search of small delicacies, unique street food, and quality handicrafts. 1) You’d almost never find Kissa Mako, a small second-floor shop focused on quality coffee and Japanese broth, if you weren’t in the know. But having found it, I can say without a doubt I enjoyed one fine cup of coffee. 2) A variety of kitchen knives are lined up on display, representing different styles and shapes that are best suited for certain culinary tasks, such as chopping vegetables and cutting meat. 3) My knife purchase from my new friend, Ishikawa-san, included the opportunity to engrave my name in Japanese katakana (symbolic characters). 4) No stop to the Tsukiji Outer Market in Tokyo is complete without trying strawberry daifuku―a red bean paste–stuffed mochi (in flavors ranging from chocolate to mango) topped with a large local strawberry. This traditional Japanese sweet was a real treat! 5) One of the best places to try tamagoyaki (a sweet egg omelet served on a stick) is at Marutake in the Tsukiji Outer Market. This delicious street food is shown here, just seconds before I happily devoured it. It’s a must-try when adventuring in Tokyo! 6) At Tanaka Shoten one can try “kasuzuke”—fish preserved in the paste leftover from making sake. One of the first steps in the process is to lightly salt the fish, in this case, fresh salmon. The result is a rich, complex flavor unlike anything I’ve ever tasted before. Delicious!

This festive occasion draws crowds from across the picturesque Camargue region, eager to partake in the procession through the city streets alongside the elegantly attired Arlésiennes in their traditional garb. The Gardians, akin to cowboys in French culture, proudly showcase their heritage.  The distinctive Arlésienne dress, originating in the mid-18th century, symbolizes a bold assertion of independence by the women of Arles. Seeking to distinguish themselves from their counterparts elsewhere in France, they adopted a style inspired by the fashionable trends of Paris at the time. Remarkably, this attire endures to this day as a proud emblem of Arles's unique cultural identity.

"Video by @michaelgeorge | This rata forest is the most stunning example of crown shyness I have ever seen. It is so precise, multiple people messaged me asking if it was computer generated. It’s not fake, but it would be nearly impossible to see this forest in real life. It’s found on Enderby Island, one of the most remote places on the planet. Close to 300 miles (480 km) south of New Zealand’s mainland, Enderby is part of the Auckland Islands and one of the rare pest-free islands where endemic species can thrive without fear of being killed by the countless invasive mammals people brought to this part of the world. Yellow-eyed penguins can be found on Enderby, as well as New Zealand sea lions and birds with songs that resemble video-game sound effects. If you turn your sound on, you can hear one from a bellbird.  For those bewildered by the term “crown shyness,” this phenomenon of certain tree species occurs when the trees’ crowns do not touch each other, forming a distinct pattern among their canopies.

"Photo by @michaelgeorge | Bermuda’s most thrilling performers are the Gombey dancers. Adorned in vibrant costumes, the Gombeys perform throughout the year during holidays and at major island events. The tradition dates back to the early 1800s and blends African, British, Native American, and Caribbean influences, reflecting the island’s diverse heritage. On a recent trip, I had a chance to watch them perform in the streets of Hamilton, Bermuda’s capital. At one point, they fully stopped traffic. As the dancers took turns executing elaborate moves to the beat of drums and other instruments, a line of cars and motorbikes backed up quickly. Rather than see this as an inconvenience, the drivers pulled out their cameras and jumped out of their cars to join the celebration. The community’s love and respect for this uniquely Bermudian tradition was powerful to witness.

Even though the Snow Hill Island colony is the closest to South America, reaching it is no easy task. Contrary to all other species of penguins, emperors breed during the Antarctic winter (Northern Hemisphere's summer). To reach the colony, you need an icebreaker with helicopters on board.

"Periods of time lasting thousands, millions, or even billions of years might seem unfathomable. So Mark Chen (@markchentx), a photographer and teacher in Houston, decided to “visualize this very mysterious idea of deep time” in more relatable terms: the stars over our heads and the rocks under foot.  Since 2022, he’s been hiking into wild places, including national parks, at night and deploying a custom-made projector to layer NASA images of star systems onto iconic natural formations in split-second bursts. Each resulting photograph features an earthly setting roughly as old, in years, as the stars’ distance from Earth in light years.  This blend of geological and galactic perspectives, capturing “how our planet has coexisted with the universe,” is now part of an ongoing series he calls Pilgrimage of Light. By comparison, we humans have been here for only a flash.

"Photos by @tarakerzhner | During my photo assignment through western Nevada, I felt myself beginning to slow down. Somewhere between the stillness of Genoa’s mineral-rich hot springs and the golden light of a Lake Tahoe sunrise, the chaos of my fast-paced life dissolved into the calm of this remarkable landscape. Of course, you still have to earn your turns, so to speak—so the Flume Trail was a must hit before wrapping up my journey in the restorative, retro-chic Reno Sauna Club.  1. Swimming in the crystal clear waters of Lake Tahoe is like moving through a natural aquarium. Beneath the surface is a whole other world.  2. At Fort Churchill State Historic Park, the structures feel like delicate outlines against the endless hills, a contrast that’s both surreal and serene. For landscape photographers, the sunrise light here is nothing short of magical.  3. Nevada’s oldest saloon doesn’t just feel historic; it is history. From the creaky wooden floors to the diamond-dust mirror, walking though Genoa Bar is like stepping into the pages of a history book.  4. The Reno Sauna Club is where retro design meets functional relaxation. After a long day, this was exactly what I needed.  5. Riding the Flume Trail means pedaling for the view—and it’s worth every turn. Bonus points if you catch it at sunset, when the pink light transforms the sheer granite cliff as you ride beneath it.  6. Paddling a clear kayak over Lake Tahoe was a one-of-a-kind experience. The water was so transparent that it felt as if I were suspended within it. It’s impossible not to feel connected to this place. | In the Silver State find the unexpected, the uncommon, and all things in between.

"Video by Rena Effendi (@renaeffendiphoto) | On the stunning lunar landscape of the Red Rock escarpment in Soudah, I came across the majestic species of the Nubian ibex, reintroduced here as part of Soudah Development’s rewilding effort to improve regional biodiversity. Ahmad Hanash, or as I called him, the “Ibex Whisperer,” is a caretaker for the shy ibex. He uses radio devices to track their movements and feeds them in their pre-release enclosures. There were nine births in captivity, as the ibex adapted to the climate conditions in their new habitat, while three females managed to breed in the wild, which attests to the project’s success. The escarpment looms over a pristine forest of juniper trees, where weaverbirds tend to their young, but this landscape has not always been so idyllic. As part of Soudah Development’s conservation efforts, over 180 tons of waste and litter has been removed. They also cleared 235 tons of an invasive species of cacti to prepare the area for animal reintroduction. | Discover the untamed beauty of #SoudahPeaks. Adventure awaits nature lovers.

There are a few bridges that have been crafted to cross in parts of the gorge, designed to blend in with their surroundings. The resulting effect looks like something out of J.R.R.

"Photo by @paoloverzone | The Pyramid of Djoser, situated in the ancient burial ground of Saqqara in Egypt, is a remarkable testament to architectural innovation and cultural significance. Often called the Step Pyramid, it was built in the 27th century B.C., during the reign of Pharaoh Djoser of the 3rd dynasty.  Architect Imhotep, a polymath and visionary, is credited with designing and building this pyramid. Imhotep's architectural brilliance transformed traditional mastaba tombs into a monumental stepped structure, setting the stage for the evolution of pyramid construction in Egypt. Imhotep's multidisciplinary skills spanned medicine, engineering, and artistry, which played a pivotal role in his ability to conceptualize and oversee the construction of this monument.  The Step Pyramid, rising six tiers high, was intended to serve as a grand funerary complex for Pharaoh Djoser, symbolizing his eternal journey and showcasing the kingdom's economic and architectural prowess. The complex includes courtyards, temples, shrines, and a vast underground labyrinthine structure, all built with limestone and adorned with intricate carvings and murals.  Imhotep's ingenuity is evident in the architectural and engineering techniques employed: a complex set of corridors and chambers, precise measurement systems, and advanced construction methods. The Step Pyramid reflects the ancient Egyptians' deep spiritual beliefs about the afterlife and is a testament to their ability to transform artistic vision into monumental reality.

The canyon marks the first leg of the journey that will take me from Dana to Petra in a 4-day adventure through the desert. The 15th-century mountain village of Dana, built in Ottoman style in an area that has been inhabited for 4,000 years, is perched on the edge of the canyon and sits near the Dana Biosphere Reserve, a complex, precious, and rich ecosystem that is now preserved and regulated.   Jordan’s endless network of trails was ambitiously redesigned in 2015 in the form of the epic 45-day, 419-mile-long (675 kilometers) Jordan Trail, cutting across the length of Jordan from its far north to the Red Sea.

In Qaanaaq, where there are fewer than a dozen (expensive) snowmobiles, Greenland dogs carry Inughuit hunters and supplies across the sea ice for most of the year. One amazing part of this ancient system is that both humans and dogs are fueled by the occasional seal caught along the way, rather than by using fossil fuels imported from a world away.

Ali Asiri told me he was the only athlete in his village community when he was growing up in Soudah. But today, his son Fawaz Asiri is an Olympian and international sportsman, who represents the country’s top sports club, Al Shabab, where he also trains young cyclists, some of whom now compete in the national teams of Saudi Arabia.

The climbers are interested in “ecopointing,” a term popularized by some European climbers to describe a human-powered adventure that produces zero fossil fuel emissions. Their goal was to make it to Devils Thumb with minimal help from motors.   The first two weeks of their journey took them through Montana and Wyoming, where they devoured rainbows, shared meals, traversed dirt roads and cattle trails alongside wild horses, and maintained their hangboard routine in preparation for their climb.

"Photo by Reuben Wu @reuben | These striking red rock formations, with their distinctive shapes and white markings, are part of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. The red-and-white coloring is due to variations in mineral content, with red hues formed by oxidized iron (rust) and white areas composed of sandstone or light-colored minerals like quartz or calcium carbonate. Over millions of years, wind and water erosion sculpted these layers into the otherworldly formations we see today. Access to this area is restricted and allowed only with a Hopi guide.

"Photo by @MichaelGeorge | It is a strange phenomenon to be surprised by the northern lights. This week, as has happened a few times this year, intense geomagnetic storms have given a show in areas where the northern lights typically can’t be seen. NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center explains that this celestial event is happening because the sun is arriving at the peak of its 11-year cycle. The northern lights have even been seen in places with intense light pollution, like New York City. I had never seen the lights except faintly, when a camera was needed to really see the colors. This week was something completely different. What initially looked like a delicate sunrise soon became a 180-degree light show of colorful fire. The pinks and greens were visible to the naked eye and eventually began to pulse, as if an electric force field was activating above. This was a lesson in using the camera I had, since the only one on me was my phone. The storms are expected to continue until October 13.

Ontario, Canada is one of the best places to do this as the thriving province holds an abundance of freshwater.

"Video by Rena Effendi (@renaeffendiphoto) | Located at the crossroads of centuries-old trading routes, the Soudah region has preserved its deep culture and history. Here, I met the Flowermen, who gather herbs at dawn in the hills around Soudah and sit in the shade of acacia trees to play music, cook and make essabh—the flower crowns, which they wear as part of their traditional tribal attire. Abou Wael, the tribal elder, told me that although the flower crowns once had the practical purpose of covering farmers’ heads from the sun, they now became an integral part of their tribal identity.   In Soudah, I tasted aseed, the most delicious bread with ghee and honey baked by Amal Turshi, who told me that she was eight years old when her mother taught her how to bake it and that she had already passed the knowledge on to her five daughters.

"Photos by Matthieu Paley (@paleyphoto) | 1. Inside the church of the Real Monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial, dappled light and serene quiet highlight the splendor of Spanish Renaissance architecture. Built between 1563 and 1584 under King Philip II, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a majestic complex that functioned as both a royal palace and a monastery.  2. Oscar Jiménez, whose family has bred horses for generations, took me on a ride through Guadarrama National Park, showcasing one of his impressive Andalusian horses. These are big horses! Known for their grace and endurance, they perfectly embody the elegance and strength of Spain’s equestrian heritage.  3. This is the view from the Chair of Philip II (Silla de Felipe II) near El Escorial in the Sierra Guadarrama. From this iconic stone chair, King Philip II reportedly oversaw the construction of the nearby monastery. Today, it provides a stunning panorama of the mountains and valley, reflecting the king’s likely appreciation for both natural beauty and architectural grandeur.  4. Getting lost in Madrid was quite the adventure! Here, passersby descend the historic Arco de Cuchilleros, a 17th-century staircase that connects Plaza Mayor with the vibrant streets below. Once a gateway for tradesmen and knife makers, this archway stands as a lasting symbol of the city’s rich history, where commerce, tradition, and daily life have intertwined for centuries.  5. Macarena Gonzales prepares the famous sandwiches at El Capricho, a renowned spot in El Rastro’s Sunday flea market. Amid the vibrant market bustle, this is the perfect place to enjoy a delicious bite while exploring the eclectic treasures of El Rastro. My tastebuds could not believe how delicious it was!  6. People-watching around Plaza de la Almudena was a blast! The square buzzes with activity—traditional dancers displaying their flair, passersby soaking up the lively atmosphere, all set against the majestic backdrop of the cathedral. It’s the perfect spot to savor Madrid’s vibrant culture and energy before heading out for tapas!

"Words by @michaelgeorge | It would take weeks to fully explore all there is to discover in and around the Casco Bay region of Maine. That’s why I went in armed with a bucket list, starting with Harraseeket Lunch and Lobster. Mainers have a commitment to harvesting and preparing impeccable cuisine. There are many restaurants where you can watch the fishermen come and go, delivering a meal that could only be fresher if you caught it yourself. From Scarborough to Freeport, state parks and sanctuaries seamlessly blend with the urban areas in and around Portland; it’s like traveling through portals into the natural world. One of my favorite portals leads to Wolfe’s Neck Woods State Park. If you’re interested in history, such as shipbuilding and Civil War–era forts, there are plenty of places to visit, like Fort Gorges, an architectural marvel just off the coast of Portland. Lastly, I can’t say exactly why it is, but lighthouses always fuel my imagination. It might be the countless poetic stories from literature, or the romantic idea of a lonely figure living by the sea. A lesser known gem is Spring Point Ledge Lighthouse. Catch it at sunset, and you can toss your bucket list over your shoulder.

"#AD Photos by @jonathan_irish | I’ve been to Amsterdam many times and have always loved its incredible architecture, endless canals, and the locals’ passion for bicycling. A recent photo assignment let me dive deeper into this vibrant city and left me even more in awe of what is surely one of Europe’s most fun and interesting places to visit.   1) Centuries-old tall, narrow houses facing the Damrak Canal in central Amsterdam seem crooked when viewed from the street. But in reality, they’ve been slightly tilted for almost as long as they’ve been around.  2) There are more bicycles than people in Amsterdam. Although the city prefers the bikes locked up in designated areas (and not on bridges), you’d have a hard time finding a bridge without one.  3) One of Amsterdam’s great treats, and a must-try when visiting the city, is stroopwafel: traditional flat waffle cookies filled with warm caramel. They are heavenly! The oldest active bakery in Amsterdam, Hans Egstorf, has been making these confections since 1898.  4) During twilight’s blue hour, city lights reflect on the Amstel Canal, one of the city’s main channels.

"Words by @michaelgeorge | People usually travel to Maine guided by a sense of adventure. I arrived guided by my stomach. Though lobster and blueberries are the staples, there are countless cuisines to discover up and down the coast.   Eating a whoopie pie is like eating a cookie that’s been magically turned into a pillow. The texture is divine, which means breaking it open is almost more fun than eating it.   If you’re looking for a sea-to-table meal that looks like a work of art, deliver yourself to Crown Jewel on Great Diamond Island. The mussels, oysters, and crudo left me wishing I had a second stomach.   You’ll find a special brew in downtown Portland at Burundi Star Coffee. The owner, Jocelyn Kamikazi, grew up in a family of coffee farmers in Burundi, and she sources the beans from her home country.   The freshest lobster I found was at Harraseeket Lunch and Lobster, where guests can look over the railing at the boats coming and going with the day’s catch. Seeing firsthand the work it takes to harvest each lobster made me even more grateful for this delicious meal.   And finally, the blueberry scone from Standard Baking Co. changed my understanding of what a baked good can be. 10 out of 10, no notes. | From coastal cities with vibrant art scenes to camping under the stars, Maine offers an abundance of charm, history, and adventure for all types of travelers looking for the perfect escape. #MaineThing @visitmaine",natgeotravel,https://www.instagram.com/p/C-IUfjPIqAV/,post_803.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1M2Tx2-c8eDDIRpDv-qHqpLiRGe8Ay0s0

"#AD Photos by @Jonathan_Irish | On my recent photo assignment to Dublin, I was blown away by this thriving, colorful, and welcoming city. Whether walking the River Liffey through the heart of the Irish capital, exploring its many neighborhoods, or meeting and laughing with the Dubliners, I found that this city stole my heart.   1) The beloved Ha’penny Bridge in Dublin crosses the River Liffey near the Temple Bar district. Built in 1816, the bridge originally had a toll of a ha’penny, or halfpenny. Today it’s free to stroll across, which I did many times on this trip!  2) Phoenix Park is the largest urban park not only in Ireland but also in all of Europe. A substantial herd of fallow deer call this park home and can often be found lounging in the open grass or wandering in the forest.   3) The Temple Bar district in central Dublin is known for its many pubs and its lively street scene. No trip to Dublin is complete without a visit to the famous neighborhood, which caters to tourists and locals alike. My favorite time to go to the Temple Bar district was at its busiest hours (weekend evenings) to really experience the craziness (and excitement) of Dublin pub life.  4) The medieval Christ Church Cathedral has been a cornerstone of Dublin city life for more than a thousand years. Established in A.D. 1030, it has survived a millennium of calm, wars, and transitions, hosting kings, queens, and presidents and millions of people who desire to be a small part of its storied history.  5) Near the gardens of the Dublin Castle, in the center of the city, you’ll find a row of very colorful buildings. Many people think Dublin is gray and full of stone, but my experience was quite different—I found Dublin to be full of color!

"Photos by Rena Effendi @renaeffendiphoto | The Kelâat M'Gouna Rose Festival takes place each spring in Morocco as roses are harvested in a valley at the foot of the Atlas Mountains amid ancient fortresses and castles made of mud brick. Before rose water and rose oil became sought-after commodities, local farmers planted rosebushes as hedges to prevent animals from entering their orchards. Here, roses are picked in the early morning hours—before the buds open, yet after they are warmed by the sun. This method ensures preservation of the fragrance and results in oil with a more distinct scent. Women sort the roses by hand and distill them into oil and rose water, which is a thriving local industry. During the last three days of April, a beauty pageant is staged where a panel of judges selects the queen of roses, the most beautiful rose picker of the season. The rose queen is paraded in a horse-drawn carriage along the main road of Kelâat M'Gouna. Each year, thousands of people gather to watch the parade at the Rose Festival, which includes a procession of traditional Amazigh dancers and musicians.

"Photo by @martinedstrom | Ever since I saw how vividly people paint their houses in Tasiilaq in eastern Greenland, I've wondered why we don't all do the same. At first, I thought these colors were used to add a bit of brightness and vibrance to the monochromatic Arctic setting—which would have been smart in itself. But as it turns out, it's part of an old, even smarter system where each color signifies something: where to find a specific type of service, for example. Yellow was used for hospitals and anything health-related, while green houses contained a radio or something to do with communications. As I recall, red houses are most common, signifying something to do with the church but also relating to trade. A smart system for remote locations, right? Imagine trying to find your way through a snowstorm in the dark Arctic winter… This makes things so much easier. Perhaps we could use the system to make our own cities smarter and easier to navigate.",natgeotravel,https://www.instagram.com/p/C7wmxnYROVg/,post_877.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1iV9Tksurxgid35XoWjgX1P-1NIiGQiRJ

"Photos by @kiliiiyuyan | 1. Stars spin around true north, over the glow of domes built for watching the night sky, at Métis Crossing in Alberta. Alberta’s night skies are some of the darkest and clearest in the world, making for excellent stargazing and, if you’re lucky, catching the northern lights.  2. At Lake Abraham in western Alberta, the Canadian Rockies fall into twilight as clouds glow in shades of sunset overhead.  3. Two fun-loving travelers take a Finnish hand-sled for a ride across the frozen surface of Lake Abraham in Alberta. With a wide-open space to play around on, the unpredictable hand-sled made for amazing gliding and equally spectacular crashes.  4. Kym Gouchie, a member of the Lheidli T’enneh First Nation, drums a silent song of gratitude to the massive cedars outside of Prince George, British Columbia. The cedar trees live in the world’s only inland rainforest, an ancient grove full of wonder—and winter—magic.  5.

"Photo by @paoloverzone | The Pyramid of Djoser, situated in the ancient burial ground of Saqqara in Egypt, is a remarkable testament to architectural innovation and cultural significance. Often called the Step Pyramid, it was built in the 27th century B.C., during the reign of Pharaoh Djoser of the 3rd dynasty.  Architect Imhotep, a polymath and visionary, is credited with designing and building this pyramid. Imhotep's architectural brilliance transformed traditional mastaba tombs into a monumental stepped structure, setting the stage for the evolution of pyramid construction in Egypt. Imhotep's multidisciplinary skills spanned medicine, engineering, and artistry, which played a pivotal role in his ability to conceptualize and oversee the construction of this monument.  The Step Pyramid, rising six tiers high, was intended to serve as a grand funerary complex for Pharaoh Djoser, symbolizing his eternal journey and showcasing the kingdom's economic and architectural prowess. The complex includes courtyards, temples, shrines, and a vast underground labyrinthine structure, all built with limestone and adorned with intricate carvings and murals.  Imhotep's ingenuity is evident in the architectural and engineering techniques employed: a complex set of corridors and chambers, precise measurement systems, and advanced construction methods. The Step Pyramid reflects the ancient Egyptians' deep spiritual beliefs about the afterlife and is a testament to their ability to transform artistic vision into monumental reality.

"Photo by @daisygilardini | I visited this wonderful cave in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard in early spring when temperatures were still well below freezing. Glacier caves are carved by the erosion of water that flows under the glacier.  Glaciers are constantly shifting and changing shape. The blue coloration of cave ice is due to the lack of air bubbles in the ice. The pressure of the glacier’s weight over thousands of years squeezes out the air. The now pure ice absorbs longer wavelengths of light, such as red and yellow, and reflects blue and green, the wavelengths that are visible to our eyes.  It's never recommended to visit glacial caves in summer. The combination of ice melt and glacial motion can be unpredictable—and dangerous.

"Photos by Matthieu Paley @paleyphoto | On my journey across Canada, a country I knew little about, I found myself welcomed with open arms and lovely accents. Following the coast around Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Québec, I was really taken by the hospitality, diversity, and the general relaxed, warm attitude of the Canadian people.  1. Elemental power rings through these massive natural structures. The Hopewell Rocks, sometimes referred to as sea stacks, were created by tidal erosion—and as the Bay of Fundy has some of the most extreme tidal shifts in the world, it’s no wonder these are so dramatic.  2. At the end of Cape Breton in Nova Scotia, I was told of pilot whales that cruise St Lawrence Bay. I didn’t hold out too much hope of spotting them, but I was too excited not give it a try! Perched on top of a boat, guess spotted the first whale? Yes, yours truly. A moment of glory I won’t forget…  3. Virginie Provencher of Les Montagnards de Charlevoix welcomed me surrounded by her horses, unfazed by the rain. It was a true immersion in this cowgirl’s life, and she obviously has strong emotional ties to the animals she so lovingly cares for. We eventually went riding into the surrounding mountains filled with the red, yellow, and orange fall colors.  4. Arriving in Montréal in the late afternoon, we went straight to look at the famous Farine Five Roses sign—a fixture of the skyline since the late 1940’s that has survived to this day! It felt like something straight out of a movie.  5. As a French national, I have a soft spot for the Québécois, French-speaking community and the way they maintain connection to their heritage. Meeting with Chef Emilie Bégin at FoodLab in Montréal, we realized we shared common roots in Normandy, a love for crème fraiche, and food in general! She made me discover Mujjol caviar, a mix of mullet and herring roes that marries beautifully with gravlax; a fresh vinaigrette of cucumber and delicious balsamic vinegar. I will be back for more!

"Photo by @michaelgeorge | I have completed countless hikes in my life, but none were as succinctly intense as the Reinebringen trail in Lofoten, Norway. Imagine you’re visiting a picturesque village and someone says you can get a spectacular view from above. The only catch is that you need to climb 1,566 steps that rise 448 meters (1,470 feet) above sea level. For context, that is 200 feet (60 meters) higher than the Empire State Building. I rarely publish photos with a crooked horizon, but this view captures the endorphins and exhaustion I felt upon reaching the top. For some historical context—the hiking path used to be extremely steep and slippery. In 2016, a project to build the stone stairway brought Sherpas from Nepal who are experts at constructing trails in mountainous terrain.

"Photos by @michaelgeorge | Chilean Patagonia’s Torres del Paine is the rare park where humans are true outsiders in a vast, legitimate wilderness. Though it occupies 930 square miles (2,400 sq km), the park received only 140,000 visitors throughout 2022. Compare that with Zion National Park, where last year close to 4.7 million people explored its 232-square-mile (600-sq-km) expanse.  This image was captured as I traveled over Lago Pehoé, which translates to “hidden lake.” The brilliant color is caused by glacial flour, or rock dust suspended in the water. Prior to visiting Torres del Paine, I presumed all photos I’d seen of it had the saturation turned up to exaggerate the colors. I was pleasantly surprised that this is not so—those colors are precisely how they look. It’s as if all the natural features that make a landscape beautiful are turned up a notch. In the distance you can see Macizo Paine, a group of mountains that look like broken teeth.",natgeotravel,https://www.instagram.com/p/C03MVN6OB4u/,post_1114.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1SAyFYiFUOcmUOdn8GXsCm0016zT-0dLp

Clouds can engulf a slope, causing whiteout conditions with no sight of the horizon, but 10 minutes later the sun can appear, to create perfect bluebird weather.

The ruins lie in the tropical rainforests that formed the hearth of lowland Maya civilization. Tikal reached its peak during the Classic period (200 to 900 C.E.). During this time, the city dominated the Maya region militarily, economically, and politically, and saw a succession of at least 33 leaders over a span of 800 years.

"Photos by Matthieu Paley (@paleyphoto) | What surprised me most when I visited the Canary Islands was the diversity of the landscapes I encountered across this relatively small archipelago.  On Lanzarote I was impressed by the ingenious technique developed by farmers who cultivate grapes in this arid and volcanic region, which has little precipitation and is famous for its trade winds. They nurture the vines in conical depressions in the soil that are protected by low stone walls. Humidity and rain collect in the cones, allowing the grapes to grow without an irrigation system. Seen from the air, these little craters, called “hoyos,” look like land art!  In Gran Canaria, I walked across the beautifully tranquil Maspalomas Dunes Nature Reserve, its towering sand waves stretching to the sea. It was surreal to experience the seclusion of this desert landscape in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.  The famous Mount Teide volcano looms over the island of Tenerife. To get there, we drove through a rainforest and up into the clouds before emerging to find this incredible view of Teide in its lunar landscape.  Later, we traveled into Gran Canaria’s interior, and suddenly the road opened up to this amazing view of Roque Bentayga.

It’s fascinating to me because I am a traditional kayak builder myself and love to see this ancient and sophisticated technology so alive. Inughuit, or northern Greenlandic Inuit, are wedded to their traditional ways of life—particularly the use of kayaks and dogsleds. The kayak is part of a hunting system with a hand-thrown harpoon and float line that allowed Inuit peoples to migrate from Siberia and survive a significant climate cooling in Greenland. During that time, Inuit had to adapt to hunting seals and narwhals efficiently. Today it remains the primary way to hunt in open water, and the use of a sophisticated traditional hunting management system alongside quotas ensures that this beautiful homeland will remain sustainably managed for millennia to come.

"Photo by @daisygilardini | The Greenland tundra's fall colors are simply mesmerizing. The tundra is a zone of treeless ground usually found north of the Arctic Circle or above the timberline. Trees cannot grow on the tundra because of the strong winds and the permafrost that lies below the surface of the black soil. Plants found in this biome include mosses, lichens, herbs, and dwarf shrubs. As with plants in more temperate climes, fall is a time for change. Shorter daylight hours, together with colder temperatures, cause photosynthesis to slow down and eventually stop. Chlorophyll is what causes leaves to appear green. When it breaks down, other chemicals take over: carotene (responsible for yellow) and anthocyanin (red).

On one of my first nights, I stumbled upon Sundance Square, a beautiful plaza in downtown Fort Worth that was lit by colorful neon lights and full of people unwinding after a long day. Later, I went to the White Elephant Saloon, a bar in the Fort Worth Stockyards National Historic District that locals recommended to me. It was packed with people dancing and having drinks and felt like the quintessential place to enjoy the city’s nightlife. The next day, I discovered a tranquil duck pond in Fort Worth’s Trinity Park—a great spot for bird-watching. While I enjoyed all that the city has to offer, my favorite experience in Fort Worth was witnessing the twice-daily longhorn cattle drive along East Exchange Avenue in the Stockyards. This is one of the oldest traditions in the city, and watching it made me feel like I had stepped back in time.

I recently visited Fort Worth, Texas, and my first stop was the Fort Worth Stockyards, the historic heart of the city and home to one of the most unique traditions I have ever witnessed. Twice a day, drovers on horseback herd longhorn cattle along East Exchange Avenue as crowds look on from the sidewalks. I’ve never seen steers with such big, beautiful horns, and I was thrilled to meet, photograph, and even pet a few before the morning drive. Afterward, I walked over to M.L. Leddy’s, a famous Western-wear shop. I couldn’t resist getting a gorgeous, hand-shaped straw hat and photographed one of their craftsmen creating its shape with steam. And since I never miss the chance to experience the nightlife in a new city, after speaking with locals, I ended up at the historic White Elephant Saloon. It was exactly what I was hoping for. The saloon was packed with people dancing and meeting up for drinks. When I left, I met Ricky, a limo driver who was waiting for people to leave the saloon. We chatted, and he let me take his portrait, which is one of my favorites from the trip. The few days I spent in Fort Worth were full of history, culture, and exuberant nightlife.

I traveled to Austin, Texas earlier this year, and one of my first stops was the Umlauf Sculpture Garden and Museum. It was filled with human-scale sculptures, and there was greenery all around. I visited in the afternoon, and finding ways to frame images in the midday light was a fun challenge. Next, I wandered around the shops on South Congress Avenue and did some street photography. With all the vibrant activity there, from musical performances to magic tricks, it was hard to know where to point the camera. In the end, as always, when I slowed down and spent some time absorbing my surroundings, I started to capture the buzzing energy of the neighborhood. Revival Cycles, a custom motorcycle shop, was an absolute feast for my lens. Everywhere I turned, there were vintage bikes and posters, and the doorways made frames for arresting photographs.

"Photo by @jonathankingston | Who knew that eastern Washington held such a hidden treasure? Palouse Falls left me speechless with its stunning and unique landscape. As I worked to capture its beauty in my picture, I searched for a composition that would convey both the story of the massive successive lava flows that blanketed much of eastern Oregon and Washington (known as the Columbia River flood basalts), as well as the enormous ice age flood that carved out the basin that now houses Palouse Falls. After exploring the park for around two hours and experimenting with different lenses, I discovered a high spot above the falls that allowed me to capture the sweeping river and cascading water.

"Photo by @rubensalgadoescudero | Yangon, Myanmar, 2015. Yangon was the capital until 2006 and remains an essential commercial hub, with a population exceeding seven million. Once called Rangoon, it is a city of contrasts that pulses with life. Its streets are home to Buddhist temples, colonial buildings, and an eclectic mix of people. On every street corner, vendors sell aromatic and diverse wares, adding to the city's vibrant atmosphere.  In 2015, Myanmar had opened its doors to tourism and was experiencing a wave of change and opportunity. It was a stark contrast to the decades of repression under a military regime that had previously kept the country closed off. But on February 1, 2021, a coup d’etat was staged by the military, ousting the democratically elected NLD party from power.

"Photos by @jimrichardsonng | Evening falls over Mar Lodge Estate in early autumn in Scotland's Cairngorms National Park, as the heather is close to its best. That heather is so predominant on the Highland moors is not entirely natural; it's also the result of a couple of centuries of managing the land for the maximum production of grouse. Estates depend on grouse for a fair bit of their income, and grouse, whose numbers climb in areas where there is more heather, were a prime draw of the estate system in the first place. Mar Lodge is one of the estates actively trying to rebalance the ecosystem, looking at ways to bring back more trees to the Highlands.

The Cardamoms were once a stronghold for Khmer Rouge fighters, a no-man's-land from which, until recently, outsiders were banned. Decades of isolation and inaccessibility kept this environment and its biodiversity nearly untouched, until loggers and poachers found their way into its forests. The ecosystem rapidly came to a critical point, but recently a few environmental organizations and a handful of locals have put their efforts together to save one of the longest remaining stretches of untouched rainforest in Southeast Asia and its biodiversity. The most evident of the area’s conservation successes stands in Chi Phat, a community of 500 families at the center of the Cardamoms, where the men who once fought the rebels now welcome and host intrepid travelers, while former poachers and loggers have now switched sides to work with the rangers.

"Photos by Jeff Mauritzen @jeffmauritzen | Words by @jkglobaltext.   Under the fluid light of Atlantic skies, the islands off Ireland’s west coast are rugged, romantic realms caught between myth and reality. Small wonder these windswept outposts have drawn filmmakers for decades. The Banshees of Inisherin is the latest film to tap the atmospheric magic of Ireland’s western shores. The setting for Martin McDonagh’s fable is a fictional Atlantic island whose name translates as “the island of Ireland.” McDonagh’s movie was shot on the Aran Islands, off Galway, and on Achill Island, further north. For visitors, both locations are well worth the effort to reach their remote shores.   Seen from above, Aran appears as a latticework of stone walls thrown over rough fields like a crocheted cloak. No trees grow on these barren limestone shards stretching out into the Atlantic. These three “stepping stones to America” hold only shallow fields, fertilized over time with seaweed. Step off the boat and you’ll hike around the same patchwork of stonewall-lined fields as the characters in Banshees. Wherever you roam, the wondrous western light prevails.   Cinematographer Cian de Buitléar, whose company supplied lighting equipment for Banshees, also filmed Islandman (2003) around Aran. “On the Atlantic Irish seaboard the weather changes so fast—it’s said you might see four seasons in a day here,” he observes. What is truly unique about the west, says the filmmaker, is its crisper, brighter quality of light than elsewhere. “This is because the Atlantic winds allow no build-up of heat haze,” he says. “So even filming on Aran, sometimes  you have crystal clear views 70 miles south to Kerry.” To read more stories from Ireland on this St. Patrick’s Day, explore the new National Geographic book ""Always Ireland” by Jack Kavanagh. #StPatricksDay",natgeotravel,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp6Cd9fPWwu/,post_1465.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1iniTfsO236Sok6y6PFkHNpS1OyyB5HQw

"Photo by @nicholesobecki | The soft pinks and purples of early dawn color the gray mangroves of Jubail Mangrove Park, a haven for species native to Abu Dhabi and birds migrating between Africa and Eurasia. Even beyond wildlife, the value of this ecosystem is immense. Coastal forests like this one function as blue carbon sinks, storing up to 10 times more carbon than their green counterparts on land (and holding it in the soil and sediment even after a tree dies). Not far away, the morning hustle was gaining pace amid towering skyscrapers, but here the lesson was one of quiet resiliency. As our world prepares for rising temperatures and seas, scientists hope that the adaptability of these mangroves—already facing abnormally high salt levels in their shallow tidal waterways, as well as wild temperature swings—will emerge in more ecosystems elsewhere in the world. | Abu Dhabi welcomes you.

"Video of Nat Geo filmmaker @bertiegregory by @danbeecham | To film underwater, you need good diving skills. Equally important is the trim of your camera’s underwater housing. It’s very hard to get steady shots with badly balanced housing. I use lots of little weights on the bottom and noncompressible foam on the top, so when I let go, the housing stays upright. When filming in open water like I am here, I also leave the housing slightly positively buoyant. This means that if, in an emergency, I dropped the housing, it would float slowly to the surface.

"Photo by @daisygilardini | A polar bear swims in open water during a mild summer day in the Svalbard archipelago. Midway between Norway and the North Pole, Svalbard is one of the last real Arctic wildernesses. Polar bears are incredibly good swimmers. Their average speed is 10 kilometers per hour (six miles per hour). The longest swim ever recorded was that of a subadult female that swam 426 miles (686 kilometers) over a period of nine days. Bears try to avoid long-distance swims when they can, though, because of the amount of energy expended while swimming. Unfortunately, due to the warming climate and the consequent loss of sea ice, long swims are becoming more frequent. While adult bears are protected from the cold water by a thick layer of fat (up to 11 centimeters, or 4.3 inches, in most cases), younger, skinnier bears and older bears are often at risk of hypothermia, which leads to drowning.

"Video by @andrea_frazzetta | The Appian Way is the most famous Roman road still in existence and, according to modern criteria, it’s the first road that was ever built. In its 380-mile (612-kilometer) span across the country, the road takes many forms: a forested dirt path, a town plaza, a busy east-west highway. It’s not always scenic or pleasant but can be an immersion into the side of southern Italy few tourists see.  To realize this project, I traveled and walked for seven weeks. At the end of my journey, I rediscovered my country as I never imagined I would. I was amazed by the beauty and outraged by the ugliness of the road’s current state of disrepair.  Protection is now under way, but without visitors, the Appia could be forgotten again. As Riccardo Carnovalini, one of the most prominent Italian hikers, told me when I met with him on the trail: “Walking is the most political act one can do to change the landscape.”  Follow me @andrea_frazzetta for more images from this project. #Italy #appianway #Roma #lastrada",natgeotravel,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl4fjFyLCmi/,post_1571.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jgysDk6HhBViTe2Gu9NmhnFoYGDjvRi4

"Photo by @francescolastrucci | It is difficult for Corleone, Sicily, to escape its stereotypes, but beyond its cinematic clichés is the real city of Corleone, rich in history, culture, faith, traditions, and friendly people. Called the city of a hundred churches, Corleone's historic center owes its splendor to its maze of alleys and the presence of precious and fascinating palaces and buildings of worship. Corleone's anti-Mafia documentation center houses some of the most important testimonies of the fight against the Mafia in Sicily. The surrounding wilderness offers breathtaking landscapes.  A few months ago, I had the pleasure to hike across the island of Sicily, Italy, starting from the North coast town of Palermo and following the paths to the South coast town of Agrigento. Long forgotten, this 9 days long walk was once part of the famous and over a thousand years old trans-european Via Francigena and it’s now a newly revived ancient pilgrimage route.

When I hiked down to the shore on this crystal clear March night, the aurora was completely absent, but after a few hours of patience in the cold, this impressive, earlike swirl suddenly formed near midnight. My heart was beating like a drum. It was hard to take my eyes off of the scene and concentrate on the camera. Thanks to the moonlight, the five-second exposure was long enough to reveal the landscape but not so long that it diffused the fast-moving aurora pattern.

"Photo by @amivitale | Meet my llama friends. They're Montana locals who love having their picture taken. Photographing curious and affectionate llamas is like photographing people. The more time you spend with them, the more open they become. And animals, just like people, need to accept you before you can make great images of them. One secret is to never look at them directly. Animals often perceive eye contact as aggression, so if you cover one eye with your hand or your camera, they feel less threatened.   Llama-trekking is one of the many activities available in remote parts of Montana. Llamas have padded feet and can eat a wide variety of vegetation. Their impact is similar to that of deer. They are also alert and sure-footed, making them ideal and helpful companions for toting gear to Swan Lake, an area outside of Glacier National Park (@glaciernps).

"Photos by @kiliiiyuyan // The Pacific Northwest is known for being wet, but up on Mount Baker, all that precipitation comes down as snow instead. In fact, Mount Baker holds the record for the most snowfall over a single winter season. Over time, that snow packs down into glacial ice. On our Mount Baker adventure, chef Melissa King and I took my handcrafted, traditional kayaks to Upper Bagley Lake and trekked about in the snow to forage for berries and other flavors of the alpine tundra. Mount Baker has many different ecosystems from bottom to top, including lush forests and alpine meadows filled with wildflowers. It’s a terrific journey to follow the Nooksack River all the way up to the snow, where it all starts. The mountain has several names in the Salish family of languages. It’s known as Kwelshán by the Lummi and Nooksack peoples, who share its lands and hold deep relationships with the mountain. // The #MazdaCX50 is purpose-built to connect you with nature.

"Video by @DaisyGilardini | The end of the life of a beautifully carved iceberg in Antarctica. The incredible life cycle of an iceberg starts thousands of years before it even reaches the sea. Snow and ice form glaciers on land. Over centuries of compression and slow movement, these glaciers expand toward the open sea. Once an iceberg calves from the mother glacier, it will float on ocean currents, at the mercy of some of the most inclement weather conditions on the planet. Snow, rain, wind, violent storms, and huge waves sculpt and carve its surface into amazing shapes and forms.

"Photo by @andrea_frazzetta | Rome’s third-century Arch of Drusus marks the informal start of a planned 360-mile (580-kilometer) walking route along the Appian Way. Although it may not seem like it, this scene is in the heart of Rome, a few hundred meters from the Baths of Caracalla.  The Appian Way is the most famous Roman road still in existence. It was one of Europe’s first highway systems and inspired the phrase ""All roads lead to Rome.""  But its legacy has been largely neglected, and its stones buried under millennia of history. Now a government project is under way to transform the Appia into a pilgrimage crossing from Rome to the sea on the heel of Italy’s boot, to bring thousands of visitors strolling across the wide, flat basalt stones.

"Photos by @MichaelGeorge | I could feel my legs burning as I cycled up to the grand overlook of Scott's View. This was one of Sir Walter Scott's favorite places to visit and sit for reflection. I welcomed the well-placed bench to catch my breath and take in the sweeping landscape, featuring Eildon Hill, an impressive formation made up of volcanic rock. Visitors can walk, cycle, or drive to this point to see the many geological features of the area. In late summer, you might even find a selection of fresh blackberries ready to be picked from the bushes at the top.   As I ambled along the River Tweed, a looming structure began to take shape in the distance. The Leaderfoot Viaduct, seen in the second image, is an iconic structure not far from the town of Melrose. The viaduct stands around 126 feet (38 meters) above the water and, because of its scenic placement, is a popular stop for travelers on the Four Abbeys Cycle Route. There are walking paths all around that allow visitors to take in the architecture from various angles. Though it is no longer in use, the viaduct was operated as part of the Berwickshire Railway from 1865 to 1948. On this clear day, I could easily imagine a steam train humming along the horizon.

"Photo by @MichaelGeorge | The owner of the Outdoor Centre in Loch Insh, Scotland, has a particularly unique connection to the country’s waterways. Here is an excerpt from my article on this region: “One afternoon I met with the organizers of the Storylands Sessions, Merryn Glover and Hamish Napier, a local writer and a musician (seen in the second image of this carousel). These sessions promote the music and stories of the region, unearthing the many narratives that weave through the local community. As Merryn explains, it is drawing from the ancient tradition of ‘cèilidh,’ a Gaelic word for a gathering in people’s homes where bards, musicians, and storytellers once met to share poetry and songs. At one of their recent events, Duncan Freshwater told the story of his father’s legal battle for the right to navigate the River Spey. The case went all the way to the House of Lords in London, where he won when a 1782 case was cited that had established a Public Right of Navigation on the Spey, a victory that goes hand-in-hand with Scotland’s ‘right to responsible access.’ This ruling helped create the country’s cherished reputation for allowing adventurers to wild camp almost anywhere, as long as they travel responsibly, by treading lightly and leaving the land as they found it. Freshwater, a last name so fitting it feels like a wink, is one of the directors of the Loch Insh Outdoor Centre along with his two brothers.” For more photos and writing from my travels, follow along @MichaelGeorge. #scotland #badenoch #lochinsh #visitscotland #cairngorms",natgeotravel,https://www.instagram.com/p/CjYNDh1jUU4/,post_1675.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fJsJYN86wmsEvIw6EKdp6qkQ68LUhDsO

"Photo by @hellokrisdavidson | A tree photographed through a car windshield during a thunderstorm on Sapelo Island, one of eight major barrier islands along the Georgia coast. Collectively, these barrier islands comprise an ephemeral landscape seemingly made of water, sand, and salt—a place shaped and governed by winds and tides. Sapelo Island is a stunningly beautiful and wild place, separated from the mainland by two sounds and nine-foot (three-meter) tides. There is no road to Sapelo—one must travel by air or water, and one must be invited. Today, most of the island belongs to Georgia and is managed by the state’s Department of Natural Resources. About a third of the island is a protected reserve where scientists study wildlife, including eagles, falcons, sea turtles, and other marsh creatures. Nestled inland is Hog Hammock, a seawater Gullah Geechee community. The few roads stretching across Sapelo are unpaved and without street signs or streetlights. Humanity’s presence feels fleeting here, as though nature might wash it away with a rainstorm. #Sapeloisland #gullahgeechee #Georgia",natgeotravel,https://www.instagram.com/p/Ci74Th_OhvO/,post_1703.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1plWpM1mrq6uvCE9e47BQqVb58ho_YStk

It’s really important to empty that water out before putting the gloves on. If you don’t, that little pocket of water gets cold during the dive and makes your fingers very, very chilly.

"Photos of @natgeo filmmaker @bertiegregory by Will West | Our expedition to Antarctica for “Epic Adventures” was, without a doubt, the hardest shoot I’ve ever done. Although the crossing from South America to Antarctica is normally rough, once we arrive we tend to film in sheltered bays and channels. But the wildlife spectacle we were searching for this time happens out in the open ocean, away from shelter. Another issue was that wildlife gatherings are thought to be biggest at the end of the Antarctic summer. As summer turns to autumn, the amount of daylight shortens and the weather gets bad. We ended up having just six good filming days on our six-week expedition. When not filming, we spent most of our time clinging to our anchorage at the infamous Elephant Island.

Having to reschedule around COVID-19 travel restrictions, I stayed closer to home and returned to Churchill, Manitoba, for the polar bear migration. Every year around this time, bears gather around the edge of the Hudson Bay. They wait there for the ice to form, then head out onto the ice to hunt for seals, their primary food source. When I returned home in mid-November, the Hudson Bay was still open water, with no ice. The bears were all around, and I could photograph them sparring in the white spruce forests just outside town. It’s quite unusual to see them among big trees. Historic data of the western Hudson Bay subpopulation of polar bears shows the bears are spending more time on land, because the ice is forming later in the season and melting earlier the following spring. The average number of days the bears spend on land has grown steadily over the past 40 years, and the consequences can be dramatic. This particular subpopulation, the most studied in the world, has declined by 30 percent since the early 1980s.

Just two miles from Stonehenge, Woodhenge was discovered as concentric ovals of empty postholes in the ground that once held wooden posts up to 25 feet tall. Woodhenge is similar to Stonehenge in that it was likely built to align with the summer solstice sunrise. However, it is thought that very different forms of rituals took place at each monument.  Today the holes are marked by short concrete pillars— not the most photogenic of locations, but I imagine how impressive the original timber structure would have looked.

"Photo by @amivitale | Sheila Walsh rides her horse as the sun sets behind her at Matador Ranch in Montana. Matador’s grassbank program, a partnership between the Nature Conservancy and local ranchers, is an innovative way to encourage conservation. It has helped to keep native grassland intact, remove obstacles to pronghorn antelope migration, improve habitat for the greater sage-grouse, reduce the risk of sage-grouse colliding with fences, preserve prairie dog towns, and prevent the spread of noxious weeds.

"​​Photo by Prasenjeet Yadav @prasen.yadav | The red fox is one of the world’s most widely distributed canids. It is found across Europe, temperate Asia, northern Africa, North America, and Australia, and occupies habitats ranging from Arctic tundra to dry deserts. During camera trapping, the red foxes would scoot by the camera as it made a sound, but they would return in a few minutes to examine the camera trap again to get comfortable with it. This fantastic Mr. Fox was captured in camera traps set up in Himachal Pradesh, India.

As its seed first took root, Genghis Khan was invading China, King John was signing the Magna Carta, and the Kingdom of Zimbabwe was established. The world's second largest rainforest, the Congo Basin could unlock vital solutions for climate adaptation—or become a ticking carbon time bomb if its resources are mismanaged.

As a result, it’s a magnet for the herbivores living here. The predators thrive during this period, as the prey is concentrated and weakened by the tough conditions.

"Photo by @mattborowick | While driving around Amboseli National Park in southwestern Kenya, we spotted a huge area with tons of different animals living in harmony together. Many of them were eating, some were sleeping, and then these two female ostriches were having a fight, trying to impress a male ostrich just out of frame. It never seemed violent. It was mostly just a lot of running and loud noises from the ostrich on the left. But by the end of the duel the male ostrich was nowhere to be seen.

"Photo by @daisygilardini | Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula sits on the Ring of Fire and is a very powerful land in many senses. Not only is the energy of its many volcanoes literally palpable, but also the creatures that call it home are simply amazing. I photographed this grizzly bear as it was fishing in Kurile Lake during a windstorm. Despite the murky water and big waves, the bear was very persistent in its pursuit of fish, and in the end it was rewarded with a big salmon.
