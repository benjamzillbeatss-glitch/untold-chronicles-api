"✂️ Moscow, 1698.  The city’s most powerful men gather to greet their ruler, Peter the Great. Instead, the towering Czar pulls out a razor—and begins hacking off their beards.  To Russians, beards aren’t fashion. They are sacred. A mark of piety, tied to the image of God. Shaving is considered a sin.  But Peter had just returned from Europe, where clean-shaven faces were the sign of modernity. To him, those beards represented the “old Russia.” And he is determined to drag his nation into the future—whether his nobles like it or not.  This is just the beginning. A beard tax. New clothes.

Our fascination with Mars goes back centuries—from 19th-century astronomers sketching “canals,” to Orson Welles sparking panic with War of the Worlds, to NASA’s Mariner 9 battling a global dust storm in 1971 and becoming the first spacecraft to orbit another planet.  Photos:  1. NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover took this selfie, made up of 62 individual images, on July 23, 2024.

By 1877, the wealthy Mexican American sailor, hunter, and rancher was a familiar face in California politics. He then set his sights on a national office, but he was far from a shoo-in.   Pacheco ran to represent a large Southern California district against incumbent Democrat Peter D. Wigginton and eked out a hard-fought victory by only one vote. But Wigginton contested the election and accused a county clerk of tampering with ballots.  Pacheco petitioned the California Supreme Court, which investigated and ruled in Pacheco’s favor, and he set out for Washington, D.C. But three months after he took office, it was stripped from him by the House’s Committee on Elections. Pacheco, however, was undaunted, and when Wigginton declined to run for re-election, Pacheco ran again and won.

Under orders from their commanders, Argentine troops inflicted no British casualties, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher assembled a naval task force of 30 warships to retake the islands. As Britain is 8,000 miles away, it took several weeks for the British warships to arrive. By June 14, the Argentine troops surrendered, effectively ending the conflict.   Humiliated in the Falkland Wars, the Argentine military was swept from power in 1983 and civilian rule was restored. In Britain, Margaret Thatcher’s popularity soared after the conflict.

While digging a well near Xi’an, China, farmers discovered a filled-in pit containing 6,000 life-size terracotta soldiers. The site was soon identified as the burial place of Emperor Qin. In addition to the large pit containing the soldiers, three more pits were discovered.   The army of life-size soldiers, archers, horses, and chariots was stationed in military formation to protect the emperor in the afterlife.

"The danger of fire in factories like the Triangle Shirtwaist was well-know, but high levels of corruption in both the garment industry and city government generally ensured that no useful precautions were taken to prevent fires.   On March 25, 1911, with over 500 workers – the majority girls and young women - present in the factory, a fire began in a rag bin. Workers and managers attempted to use the firehouse to extinguish it but was unsuccessful. The young workers tried to exit by the elevator, but it was only able to make four trips before it broke down. Workers resorted to fleeing through the stairwells but found themselves locked out of the only accessible one. Those working in floors above were able to escape to the roof and jump to adjoining buildings. And girls who did not make it to the other options began to jump from the windows to escape. Once the firefighters arrived, it took 18 minutes to bring the fire under control. But a total of 146 people were killed in the fire.   The fire helped unite organized labor and reform-minded politicians and the workers union set up a march to protest the conditions that led to the fire.

"After her husband was incapacitated in an accident, Emily Warren Roebling (pictured) took over supervising the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. Learn more below.   The construction of the Brooklyn Bridge began with a freak accident. In 1869, bridge designer John Augustus Roebling was hit by an approaching ferry. He died three weeks later, and the job of chief engineer went to his eldest son, Washington Roebling.   Three years later, Washington himself was incapacitated by “caisson disease” (now known as decompression sickness or “the bends”).

"Did you know Coretta Scott King took an interest in activism before she married the man who would become the nation’s foremost civil rights leader?   Born in Alabama, she experienced racism from a young age. Her family’s landownership made them a target for white racists who burned down their home. She attended a segregated school where she graduated top of her class. From there, she headed to an integrated school in Ohio where she joined the NAACP and college committees focused on racial equality.   She would later meet King in 1952 and together, they became involved in the Montgomery Bus Boycott. She even helped King as he developed talks and sermons, offering suggestions on his speeches and strategy.    Throughout her 13-year marriage to King and in the decades after his death, she worked for justice, standing against racism and war.

But professional Bill Spiller, a Black golfer, was denied entry. (Louis’ entry as an amateur was not governed by PGA rules.)

"When Frida Kahlo was 18 years old, she seemed on the verge of claiming the life she’d imagined. But in September 1924, all of that changed.   When the bus Kahlo was riding hit a trolley car, she suffered serious internal injuries as a long metal rod tore through her midsection. Her injuries were so severe that she had to be encased in a full-body plaster case. The carefree years of her childhood ended abruptly. But what sustained her throughout her days in bed was painting.   As she gained confidence and self-assurance as a painter, she began alluding to a range of traumas she endured.

The Hollywood Ten were all convicted of obstructing the investigation and served jail times.   Pressured by Congress, many Hollywood establishments started a blacklist policy, banning the work of more than 300 screenwriters, actors and directors.

She was the first Miss Black America, and her message was clear: Black is beautiful too.  Phillip H. Savage, then director of the Tri-State NAACP, helped the groundbreaking pageant get national coverage. They decided to hold it the same night, and in the same city, as the Miss America pageant. They chose to start their pageant at midnight, in hopes that newsmen would drop by when they left Convention Hall after the conclusion of the other pageant.

"Would you trade your home for a pearl necklace? The building you see here, was formerly the home of Morton F. Plant...    After inheriting his father’s railway company and fortune in 1899, Morton Plant married the recently divorced socialite Mae “Maisie” Cadwell Manwaring, that you see in the second photo. It was said Plant paid Mae’s previous husband $8,000,000 to agree to a divorce.    Plant built his mansion in 1905 on the east side of 5th Avenue alongside a string of other wealthy family homes, like the Vanderbilt’s and Astor’s.    But why did Plant sell his house for a pearl necklace? Maisie Plant had fallen in love with a double strand of 128 pearls with a diamond clasp, said to be worth $1,000,000 made by Cartier. (The jewelry in slide 4 is similar to the necklace Maisie loved)   Cartier offered to trade the necklace, plus $100, for the Plant Mansion. So, for the love of Maisie, Plant accepted.    Soon after the trade, harvested pearls were created and the price of authentic pearls dropped, making the necklace plummet in value. And the iconic necklace has yet to resurface. 📸: Cartier store on 5th Avenue; 1987 📸: Portrait of Sarah Mae ""Maisie"" Cadwell Plant Rovensky; 1987 📸: Pedestrians, cars and coaches passing in front of Vanderbilt Mansion, on Fifth Avenue; 1900 📸: Jewelry and a Cartier Baignoire wristwatch in a display case at a Cartier; 2021 📸: The exterior of the Cartier mansion on 5th Avenue; 2008",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cu_-12fuH8v/,post_549.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YtD9YMNgbuL0WxX4AgnJJJ_4fwX1XBqg

"“Remember the ladies,” Abigail Adams wrote to her husband, future-president John Adams, on #ThisDayInHistory in 1776.    John Adams was in Philadelphia as part of the Continental Congress when Abigail Adams wrote him that “I long to hear that you have declared an independency–and by the way in the new code of laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors.”   Abigail Adams’ message was part of a life of advocacy. She challenged social and political limitations by advocating for women’s rights, education, and the abolition of slavery.    The hollow-cut silhouette from @smithsoniannpg’s collection captures her later in life, probably 1804.

"Shortly after the German occupation of Poland began, the Nazis forced the city’s Jewish citizens into a “ghetto” surrounded by barbed wire and armed SS guards. The Warsaw Ghetto soon held almost 450,000 Jews in deplorable conditions and beginning in July 1942, 6,000 Jews a day were transferred to the Treblinka extermination camp.

In January 1943 when the Nazis entered to the ghetto to prepare a group for transfer, the resistance group ambushed them.

"The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. When it was signed into law on July 2, 1964, it was a major victory for the civil rights movement in its battle against unjust Jim Crow laws that marginalized Black Americans. It took years of activism, courage, and the leadership of Civil Rights icons from Martin Luther King, Jr. to the Little Rock Nine to bring the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to fruition. Here are some of the key steps that ultimately led to the Act’s adoption.   The 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education declared that segregating children in public schools was unconstitutional, setting a critical precedent that “separate but equal” facilities were not equal in the eyes of the law.   The Little Rock Nine was a group of Black students sent to integrate the all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas in September 1957. Their enrollment was a test to the Brown v. Board of Education.   In 1961, Freedom Riders, a group of Black and white protestors organized by the Congress on Racial Equality, attempted to use white-only restrooms, lunch counters and waiting rooms, testing the 1960 Supreme Court decision in Boynton v. Virginia that ruled segregation of interstate transportation facilities unconstitutional.   The Freedom Summer of 1964 was a voter registration drive for Black voters across Mississippi who faced harassment and intimidation at the polls.

Despite long standing tensions with the U.S., Mexico would become a valuable ally to its northern neighbors, ramping up its industrial production and contributing vital resources to the Allied war effort.   In addition, thousands of Mexican nationals living in the U.S. registered for military services during World War II.

"As war spread across Europe in 1940, the head of France’s military counterintelligence service recruited an unlikely spy: the American-born expatriate – Josephine Baker.   Jacques Abtey, head of the French counter-military intelligence, had spent the early days of World War II recruiting spies to collect information on Nazi Germany and other Axis powers. Typically, he sought out men who could travel incognito. Then again, nothing was typical when it came to the dancer and singer, Josephine Baker.   A celebrity of Baker’s stature made for the most unlikely spy candidate since she could never travel secretly – but that’s exactly what made her such an enticing prospect. Fame would be her cover. Abtey hoped Baker could use her charm and stardom to extract secrets from diplomats. Having found in France the freedom that sometimes eluded her in the U.S., Baker agreed to spy for her adopted country.

"Women's gymnastics has been an official sport in the Summer Olympics since 1928, when the first female Olympic gymnasts competed in Amsterdam. Since then, it has become one of the most popular sports in the international games. Here’s a look at some of the sport’s most memorable moments in Olympics history.   The 1948 London Olympics marked the return of the Olympic Games after World War II, and it also marked the first time the U.S. women's gymnastics team won a medal in the team competition.   In 1976, 14-year-old Nadia Comăneci became the first gymnast to receive a perfect 10 in an Olympic event.   The 1996 Atlanta Olympics were a major year for U.S. women's gymnastics. Dominique Dawes won bronze in the individual floor exercise, becoming the first Black American woman to win an Olympic medal in gymnastics.   At the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Simone Biles attended and dazzled. As the winner of 30 Olympic and World Championship medals and the only woman to hold seven all-around U.S. championship titles, she is currently one of the most decorated U.S. gymnasts.

"The rainbow flag, a universal symbol of the LGBTQ community, was created in 1978 by artist, designer, veteran, and then-drag performer, Gilbert Baker.   At the time, the most commonly used image for the gay rights movement was a pink triangle, a symbol used by the Nazis to identify homosexuals. Using a symbol with such a dark and painful past was never an option for Baker.   The different colors within the flag were meant to represent togetherness since the LGBTQ community embodies all races, ages, and genders, and rainbows are both natural and beautiful.   With the help of close to 30 volunteers, Baker was able to construct the first draft of the now world-renowned rainbow flag. It was first showcased at San Francisco’s Gay Freedom Day Parade on June 25, 1978.   Now there are 22 different Pride flags that represent the LGBTQ+ community.

He enrolled at Harvard University at 16 and went on to teach school and study law before becoming America’s second president in 1797.

In 1776, he anonymously published “Thoughts on Government,” which proposed the three-branched system upon which the United States government is modeled.  Intelligent, patriotic, opinionated, and blunt, Adams became a critic of Great Britain’s authority in colonial America and viewed the British imposition of high taxes and tariffs as a tool of oppression. During the 1770s, he was a delegate to the Continental Congress. In the 1780s, Adams served as the diplomat in Europe and helped negotiate the Treaty of Paris which officially ended the American Revolutionary War.

Seven years before, Ali had lost his title when the government accused him of draft-dodging and the boxing commission took away his license.   The “Rumble in the Jungle” was Africa’s first world heavyweight championship match. The government of the Central African nation staged the event - its president, Mobutu Sese Seko, personally paid each of the fighters $5 million simply for showing up. At 4:30am, 60,000 spectators gathered in the moonlight at the outdoor Stade du 20 Mai to watch the fight. They were chanting “Ali, bomaye” (“Ali, kill him”) in the Lingala language. When the fighters entered the ring, Foreman possessed the heavyweight title, but Ali owned the hearts of the crowd. By the eighth round, the referee counted Foreman out and declared Ali the champion by knockout. Ali had become only the second heavyweight in history, behind Floyd Patterson, to regain his championship belt.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1929, Black Tuesday hit Wall Street as investors traded some 16 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors, and stock tickers ran hours behind because the machinery could not handle the tremendous volume of trading. During the succeeding weeks, stock prices had nowhere to go but up, so there was considerable recovery.   In the aftermath of Black Tuesday, America and the rest of the industrialized world spiraled downward into the Great Depression. The stock market crash of 1929 was not the sole cause of the Great Depression, but it did accelerate the global economic collapse of which it was a symptom. By 1933, nearly half of America’s banks had failed, unemployment was approaching 15 million people or 25% of the workforce.

"In Washington, D.C. nearly 100,000 people gathered to protest the American war effort in Vietnam on #ThisDayInHistory in 1967. Around 30,000 of the protestors marched to the Pentagon to ask for an end to the conflict. The protest was the most dramatic sign of waning U.S. support for President Lyndon Johnson’s war in Vietnam. Polls taken in the summer of 1967 revealed that American support for the war had fallen below 50%.   The peace movement began to push harder for an end to the war - the march on Washington was the most powerful sign of their commitment to the cause. The protest was also important in suggesting that the domestic Cold War consensus was beginning to fracture.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1931, gangster Al Capone is sentenced to 11 years in prison for tax evasion and fined $80,000, signaling the downfall of one of the most notorious criminals of the 1920s and 1930s.   Alphonse Gabriel Capone was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1899 to Italian immigrants. Capone’s adolescence was far from innocent; he was expelled from school at 14, joined a gang, and was slashed across the cheek during a fight, prompting the nickname “Scarface”. Shortly after he moved to Chicago in 1920, Capone became an integral piece of crime boss Johnny Torrio’s illegal enterprises which included alcohol smuggling, prostitution, and gambling. In just five years, Capone became the fearless kingpin of Chicago crime after an assassination attempt left Torrio seriously wounded. Around 1930, Capone topped the F.B.I’s “Most Wanted” list but avoided long stints in jail until 1931. A slew of federal tax evasion charges finally caught up to him, however, Capone served less than 8 years of his 11-year sentence. In 1939, Capone was granted early release for good behavior. In 1947, Capone died at his home in Palm Island, FL at the age of 48.

"Pablo Picasso, one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century, was born in Malaga, Spain on #ThisDayInHistory in 1881. Picasso’s father was a professor of drawing and began teaching him to draw and paint when he was a child. By the time he was 13, he had his first exhibit and his skill level had surpassed his father’s.   Picasso remained renowned for endless reinventing himself, switching between styles so radically different that his life’s work seems to be the product of five or six great artists rather than just one. His work, which comprises more than 50,000 paintings, drawings, engravings, sculptures, and ceramics produced over 80 years, is described in a series of overlapping periods - the Blue Period, the Rose Period, and the Cubist movement. After Cubism, Picasso explored classical and Mediterranean themes, and images of violence and anguish increasingly appeared in his work. He continued to produce art with undiminished force until his death in 1973.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1858, future President Theodore Roosevelt was born in New York City. Roosevelt was home-schooled and then attended Harvard University, graduating in 1880. He served as New York’s governor from 1899 to 1900.   Roosevelt unexpectedly became the 26th president of the United States in September 1901 after the assassination of William McKinley. Young and physically robust, he brought a new energy to the White House, and won a second term on his own merits in 1904. Roosevelt, a Republican, confronted the bitter struggle between management and labor head-on and became known as the great “trust buster” for his strenuous efforts to break up industrial combinations using the Sherman Antitrust Act. He was also a dedicated conservationist, setting aside some 230 million acres for national forests, reserves and wildlife refuges during his presidency. In the foreign policy arena, Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize for his negotiations to end the Russo-Japanese War and spearheaded the beginning of construction on the Panama Canal. After leaving the White House and going on a yearlong safari in Africa, he returned to politics in 1912, mounting a failed run for president at the head of a new Progressive Party.

"Mata Hari, World War I’s most notorious spy, was executed for espionage on #ThisDayInHistory in 1917. In 1905, she arrived in Paris and reached stardom as an exotic dancer. While touring Europe, she claimed she was born in a sacred Indian temple. In reality, she was born in a small town in northern Holland as Margaretha Geertruida Zelle. Her deceptive persona still packed dance halls and opera houses from Russia to France.   The details of Mata Hari’s espionage career are scarce, but it seemed to have commenced in 1915 after Karl Kroemer, the honorary German consul in Amsterdam, approached her. He offered her 20,000 francs to become a spy for the Kaiser. She accepted the money but whether she participated in the espionage remains unclear. Over the next several months, Hari continued her travels in Europe and had affairs with military officers and politicians.  In February 1917, French authorities arrested her for espionage and imprisoned her in Paris. Despite a lack of evidence concerning secrets she might have revealed to the Germans, prosecutors blamed her for the deaths of thousands of Allied soldiers and pointed to her numerous affairs as proof that she had been gathering intelligence.

A member of the Nazi party, Schindler ran an enamel-works factory in Krakow during the German occupation of Poland, employing workers from the nearby Jewish ghetto. Initially, Schindler hired Jewish workers because they were a less expensive Polish workforce. As the Nazi atrocities against the Jewish community increased, Schindler’s attitude changed. In 1944, most of the Jews in the region were being sent to Auschwitz, but Schindler bribed officials into allowing him to keep his workers and set up a factory in a safer location in occupied Czechoslovakia. Not wanting to contribute to the German war effort, he ordered his workers to purposefully make defective products that would fail inspection. By the war’s end, he was penniless, but he had saved 1,200 Jews.   In 1962, he was declared a Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem, Israel’s official agency for remembering the Holocaust.

Poe’s death left a mystery that has lingered for more than a century.

The miner’s ordeal began on August 5, 2010, when a portion of the San Jose gold and copper mine where they were working collapsed. The 33 men moved to an underground emergency shelter area, where they discovered just several days’ worth of food rations.   On August 22, a drill sent by rescuers broke through to the area where the miners were located and the men sent back up a note saying, “We are fine in the refuge, the 33.” Food, water, letters, medicine, and other supplies were soon delivered to the miners via a narrow bore hole. As engineering and mining experts from around the world collaborated on the long, complex process of devising a way to bring the 33 men up to the service, the miners maintained a system of jobs and routines in order to keep up morale.   Rescuers eventually drilled and reinforced an escape shaft wide enough to extract the men, one by one. The approximately 2,000-foot ascent to the surface in the capsule took around 15 minutes for each man.

"130 years ago, on #ThisDayInHistory, an act of Congress established Yosemite National Park, becoming America’s third national park. Environmental trailblazer John Muir and his colleagues campaigned for the congressional action that was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison.   Native Americans were the main residents of the Yosemite Valley until the 1849 gold rush brought thousands of non-Indian miners and settlers to the region. Tourists and damage to the Yosemite Valley’s ecosystem followed. In 1864, to ward off further commercial exploitation, conservationists convinced President Abraham Lincoln to declare Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias a public trust of California. This marked the first time the U.S. government protected land for public enjoyment, and it laid the foundation for the establishment of the national and state park systems.   In 1889, John Muir discovered that the vast meadows surrounding Yosemite Valley were being overrun and destroyed by domestic sheep grazing. Muir and Robert Underwood Johnson, a fellow environmentalist, lobbied for national park status for the large wilderness area around Yosemite Valley.

"President Harry Truman made the first-ever televised presidential address from the White House on #ThisDayInHistory in 1947. Truman asked the Americans to cut back on their use of grain in order to help starving Europeans.   At the time of Truman’s food-conservation speech, Europe was still recovering from World War II and suffering from famine. Truman worried that if the U.S. didn’t provide food aid, his administration’s Marshall Plan for European economic recovery would fall apart before it even got started. The food program was short-lived, as ultimately the Marshall Plan succeeded in helping to spur economic revitalization and growth in Europe.   In 1947, television was still in its infancy and the number of TV sets in U.S. homes only numbered in the thousands; most people listened to the radio for news and entertainment. However, although the majority of Americans missed Truman’s TV debut, his speech signaled the start of a powerful and complex relationship between the White House and a medium that would have an enormous impact on the American presidency, from how candidates campaigned to how the president communicated with the American people.

The demonstrators – Black and White, poor and rich – came together in the nation’s capital demanding voting rights and equal opportunity for African Americans and to appeal for an end to racial segregation and discrimination.   The peaceful rally was the largest assembly for a redress of grievances that the capital had ever seen, and King was the last speaker. With the statue of Abraham Lincoln – the Great Emancipator- towering behind him, he told the struggle of ahead, stressing the importance of continued action and nonviolent protest.   “I have a dream,” he boomed over the crowd stretching from the Lincoln Memorial to the Washington Monument, “that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.’” He equated the civil rights movement with the highest and noblest ideals of the American tradition, allowing many to see for the first time the importance of urgency of racial equality.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1965, over 1,000 Filipino-American farmworkers refused to go to work picking grapes in the Central Valley north of Bakersfield, California. They set into motion a chain of events that would extend over the next five years, the Delano Grape Strike.   Filipino and Mexican immigrants worked for decades along the West Coast, moving with the seasons to harvest the region’s crops. Many of the workers grew restless, as many of the workers were anxious for decent medical care and retirement funds. When Filipino labor organizer, Larry Itliong, declared a strike, he asked for the support of the National Farm Workers Association and its Mexican-American founders, Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta.   The Strike’s leadership asked Americans to boycott the popular California fruit because of the paltry pay and poor work conditions agricultural laborers were forced to endure. Using nonviolent tactics like marches and hunger strikes, grape pickers made their plight a part of the national civil-rights conversation. It took time, but their efforts paid off. In 1970, farm workers won a union contract promising better pay and benefits. A few years later, their efforts led to the passage of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, which established collective-bargaining power for farmworkers statewide.

The inspiration for the record book can be traced to November 1951 when Sir Hugh Beaver, managing director of Guinness Brewery, was on a hunting trip in Ireland. After failing to shoot a golden plover, Beaver and the members of his party debated whether the creature was Europe’s fastest game bird but were unable to locate a book with the answer.   Thinking that patrons of Irish and British pubs would enjoy a record book which could be used to settle friendly disagreements, Beaver decided to have one produced. He hired twin brothers Norris and Ross McWhirter, the founders of a London-based agency that provided facts and statistics to newspapers and advertisers. The book was intended to be given away for free in pubs to promote the Guinness brand; however, it turned out to be so popular that the company started selling it that fall. The McWhirter twins traveled the globe to research and verify records.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1864, the Geneva Convention of 1864 for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick Armies in the Field is adopted by 12 nations meeting in Geneva. The agreement empowered the development of the International Red Cross and called for nonpartisan care to the sick and wounded in times of war, regardless of nationality.   Jean-Henri Dunant advocated for the establishment of national relief organizations after witnessing the bloody aftermath of the 1859 Battle of Solferino in Italy, in which there was little medical support for injured soldiers.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 79 AD, after centuries of dormancy, Mount Vesuvius erupted in southern Italy, devastating the prosperous Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum and killing thousands. The cities, buried under a thick layer of volcanic material and mud, were never rebuilt.   In the time of the early Roman Empire, 20,000 people lived in Pompeii and 5,000 people in Herculaneum. During the eruption, many occupants attempted to flee but some 2,000 people stayed holed up in cellars hoping to wait out the eruption. The people who remained were killed the next morning when a cloud of toxic gas poured into the city. After the eruption, Pompeii was buried under 14 to 17 feet of ash and pumice. Herculaneum was buried under more than 60 feet of mud and volcanic material. In the 18th century, the two cities were rediscovered and excavated, providing an unprecedented archaeological record of the everyday life of an ancient civilization.   Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, destroying several cities in the Roman Empire. Today, it is still considered an active volcano.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1814, First Lady Dolley Madison saved a portrait of George Washington from being looted by British troops during the war of 1812.   President James Madison left the White House on August 22 to meet with his generals on the battlefield, as British troops threatened to enter the capitol. Before leaving, he asked his wife Dolley to gather important state papers and be prepared to abandon the White House at any moment.   The next day, British troops gathered in the distance and Dolley decided to abandon the couple’s personal belongings and save the full-length portrait of former president and national icon George Washington from decoration by vengeful British soldiers.   Since the painting was screwed to the wall, she ordered the frame to be broken and the canvas pulled out and rolled up.

"65 years ago, on #ThisDayInHistory, 14-year-old, Emmett Till was lynched after allegedly whistling at a white woman four days earlier.   While visiting with his cousins in Mississippi, they entered a nearby store to buy candy. The white woman behind the counter, Carolyn Bryant, claimed that Till grabbed her, made lewd advances and wolf-whistled at her.   Carolyn’s husband, Roy, returned from a business trip a few days later and heard how Emmett allegedly spoke to his wife. Enraged, he went to the home of Till’s great uncle demanding to see him. They forced Emmett into their car, beat him and shot him in the head. The men were tried for murder, but an all-white male jury acquitted them.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1911, the Louvre announced the Mona Lisa was stolen. The thief, Vincenzo Peruggia, was discovered and arrested two years later in 1913. The former Louvre employee simply walked into the museum, removed the famed painting from the wall, hid it beneath his clothes, and escaped.   Peruggia claimed that he had acted out of a patriotic duty to avenge Italy on behalf of Napoleon. But prior robbery convictions and a diary with a list of art collectors led most to think that he acted solely out of greed.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1944, Paris was liberated by the French 2nd Armored Division and the U.S. 4th Infantry Division after four years of Nazi occupation.   The 2nd Armored Division advanced on the city from the west and the 4th Infantry Division from the south. Hitler ordered Paris defended to the last man and demanded that the city not fall into Allied hands except as “a field of ruins.” General Dietrich von Choltitz, commander of the German garrison, dutifully began laying explosives under Paris’ bridges and many of its landmarks but disobeyed an order to commence the destruction.   As the 2nd Armored Division reached the heart of Paris, German resistance was light and most of the 20,000 troops surrendered or led.

"Thurgood Marshall became the first African American to be confirmed as a Supreme Court justice on #ThisDayInHistory in 1967. He remained on the Supreme Court for 24 years.   From a young age, Marshall seemed destined for a place in the American justice system. His parents instilled in him an appreciation for the Constitution, a feeling that was reinforced by his schoolteachers. After graduating from the Lincoln University in 1930, he sought admission to the University of Maryland School of Law but was turned away because of the school’s segregation policy. Instead, he attended the Howard University School of Law, from which he graduated magna cum laude in 1933. Over the next two decades, Marshall distinguished himself as one of the country’s leading advocates for civil rights, winning 29 of the 32 cases he argued in front of the Supreme Court, all of which challenged in some way the ‘separate but equal doctrine’.   By 1961, Marshall was appointed by President John F. Kennedy to the U.S. court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, a position he held until 1965, when Kennedy’s successor, Lyndon B. Johnson named him U.S. Solicitor General. In 1967, President Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court. Over the next 24 years, Justice Marshall came out in favor of abortion rights and against the death penalty, as he continued his tireless commitment to ensuring equitable treatment of individual – particularly minorities – by state and federal governments.

"After centuries as a royal palace, the Louvre opened as a public museum on #ThisDayInHistory in 1793.   In 1546, King Francis I ordered the 12th century Louvre Castle torn down and replaced with a new palace. Francis was a great art collector, and the Louvre was to serve as his royal residence. Almost every subsequent French monarch extended the Louvre and its grounds, and major additions were made by Louis XIII and Louis XIV in the 17th century. In 1682, Louis XIV moved his court to Versailles, and the Louvre ceased to be the main royal residence.   During the French Revolution, part of the Louvre was opened as a public museum. The French army seized art and archaeological items from territory and nations conquered in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, adding to its collection. Many of these items and artworks were returned after Napoleon’s defeat in 1815, but the Louvre’s current Egyptian antiquities collections and other departments were built during Napoleon’s conquests.   Today, the Louvre’s collection is one of the richest in the world, with artwork and artifacts representative of 11,000 years of human civilization and culture.

"100-years ago, on #ThisDayInHistory, famed Mexican revolutionary, Pancho Villa, reached an agreement with interim Mexican president Adolfo De la Huerta to retire from armed conflict to help bring peace and stability to Mexico. Villa was a bandit who was later inspired by reformer Francisco Madero, helping him to win the Mexican Revolution. After a coup by Victoriano Huerta, Villa formed his own army to oppose the dictator, with more battles to follow as Mexican leadership remained in a state of flux.   The fact that the majority of Villa's battles were on the northern border of Mexico brought the revolutionary to the spotlight in terms of photographs and stories covering the events in Mexico. And surprisingly, the former bandit who once hid his presence and changed his name to avoid attention loved being photographed.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1934, a group of the most dangerous federal prisoners in the U.S. penal system arrived on Alcatraz Island. The convicts - were the first civilian prisoners housed in the new high-security penitentiary – joined a few dozen military prisoners left over from the island’s days as a U.S. military prison.   Alcatraz was an uninhabited seabird haven when it was explored by Spanish Lieutenant Juan Manuel de Ayala in 1775. He named it Isla de los Alcatraces, or Island of the Pelicans. Fortified by the Spanish, Alcatraz was sold to the United States in 1849. Beginning in 1859, a U.S. Army detachment was garrisoned there and from 1868 Alcatraz was used to house military criminals. In 1907, Alcatraz was designated the Pacific Branch of the United States Military Prison until it was fortified into a high-security federal penitentiary in 1934.   Although some three-dozen attempted, no prisoner was known to have successfully escaped “The Rock.” In 1963, U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ordered Alcatraz closed.

Eisenhower signed a law officially declaring “In God We Trust” to be the nation’s official motto. Although Eisenhower embraced religion, biographers insist he never intended to force his beliefs on anyone.  The law also mandated that the phrase be printed on all American paper currency. The phrase had been placed on U.S. coins since the the Civil War when religious sentiment reached a peak. Eisenhower’s treasury secretary, George Humphrey, had suggested adding the phrase to paper currency as well.  The first paper money with the phrase “In God We Trust” was not printed until 1957.

The spacecraft, named after the Russian word for satellite, was launched at 10:29 p.m. Moscow time from Tyuratam launch base in the Kazakh Republic. Sputnik traveled at 18,000 miles an hour and its elliptical orbit had an apogee (farthest point from Earth) of 584 miles and a perigee (nearest point) of 134 miles. By January 1958, Sputnik’s orbit deteriorated, as expected, and the spacecraft burned up in the atmosphere.   Sputnik was launched to correspond with the International Geophysical Year, a solar period that the International Council of Scientific Unions declared would be ideal for the launching of artificial satellites to study Earth and the solar system. However, many Americans feared more sinister uses of the Soviets’ new rocket. Sputnik was some 10 times the size of the first planned U.S. satellite, which was not scheduled to be launched until the next year.

In her final entry, Frank wrote of how others perceived her, describing herself as “a bundle of contradictions.” She wrote: “As I’ve told you many times, I’m split in two. One side contains my exuberant cheerfulness, my flippancy, my joy in life and, above all, my ability to appreciate the lighter side of things. By that I mean not finding anything wrong with flirtations, a kiss, an embrace, an off-color joke. This side of me is usually lying in wait to ambush the other one, which is much purer, deeper and finer...”   She continued that what she says is not what she feels, which is why, in her words, she had a reputation for being “boy-crazy as well as a flirt, a smart aleck and a reader of romances.”  “The happy-go-lucky Anne laughs, gives a flippant reply, shrugs her shoulders and pretends she doesn’t give a darn. The quiet Anne reacts in just the opposite way. If I’m being completely honest, I’ll have to admit that it does matter to me, that I’m trying very hard to change myself, but that I'm always up against a more powerful enemy.”  Learn more about Anne Frank’s private diary and how it became an international sensation.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1996, at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, the U.S. women’s gymnastics team wins its first-ever team gold.   The 1996 U.S. women’s team was made up of seven immensely talented teenaged girls: Amanda Borden, Amy Chow, Dominique Dawes, Shannon Miller, Dominique Moceanu, Jaycie Phelps and Kerri Strug. Nicknamed the Mag 7, the team was considered America’s best shot ever at an Olympic team gold, something no American women’s gymnastics team had ever won.   To win gold, the U.S. women faced a battle with Russia and Romania, the two-time defending world champions. The final event of the team competition for the U.S. was the vault.   It was left to Strug, America’s second and final vaulter, to seal the win. On her first attempt, Strug fell on the landing, and heard an alarming pop in her ankle. Strug bravely readied herself to vault on her badly sprained ankle. After executing a perfect one-and-a-half twisting Yurchenko, she landed solidly on two feet. She then spun and hopped on one foot towards the judges’ table before collapsing in pain. Her 9.712 score was announced to resounding applause.

Fifty-six congressional delegates in total signed the document, including some who were not present at the voting who approved the declaration.   Exactly one month before the signing of the document, Congress had accepted a resolution put forward by Richard Henry Lee that stated “Resolved: That these United Colonies are, and of right out to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and out to be, totally dissolved.”   Congress adopted the more poetic Declaration of Independence drafted by Thomas Jefferson two days later on July 4th.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1619, the first enslaved Africans arrived in Port Comfort, Virginia, marking the beginning of two and a half centuries of slavery in North America.   Angolans kidnapped by the Portuguese arrived in the British colony of Virginia and then were bought by English colonists. They were disembarked at Point Comfort, in what is today known as Hampton Roads. The arrival at Point Comfort marked a new chapter in the history of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, which began in the early 1500s and continued into the mid-1800s. Of the over 12 million slaves taken from Africa, about 600,000 were taken to North America. Their labor and that of their descendants were crucial to the economies of the British colonies and the United States.   Because it became a crucial part of the culture and economy of early America after its introduction in Virginia, slavery is often referred to as the nation’s “original sin.” To learn more, visit the link in our bio.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/CEH0kktBgJQ/,post_1505.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NAqbua6LBxvVt6zHdYeZSGZs7tpEPz1e
"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1868, the 14th Amendment, granting citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States - including formerly enslaved people – became part of the U.S. Constitution. The amendment then reaffirmed the privileges and rights of all citizens, and granted all these citizens the “equal protection of the laws.”  In the decades after its adoption, the equal protection clause was cited by a number of African American activists who argued that racial segregation denied them the equal protection of law.   In 1896, the Plessy v. Ferguson decision, affirming federal toleration of the so-called “separate but equal” doctrine, was eventually used to justify segregating all public facilities. However, “colored” facilities were never equal to their white counterparts, and African Americans suffered through decades of debilitating discrimination in the South and elsewhere. In 1954, Plessy v. Ferguson’s core argument was rejected by the Supreme Court in its ruling in Brown v. Board of Education Topeka.

The Greensboro sit-in was a civil rights protest in which young African American college and high school students staged a sit-in at a segregated Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C., and refused to leave after being denied service. Ezell Blair Jr., David Richmond, Franklin McCain, and Joseph McNeil, known as the Greensboro Four, were the four young Black men who staged the first sit-in.

On July 21, Union and Confederate armies clashed near Manassas Junction, Virginia. The engagement began when Union troops marched from the federal capital in Washington, D.C. to strike a Confederate force along a small river known as Bull Run. After fighting on the defensive for most of the day, Confederate forces were able to break the Union right flank, sending Union troops into a chaotic retreat towards Washington.   The First Battle of Bull Run cost some 2,900 Union casualties, compared with nearly 2,000 for the Confederates.

"Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin became the first two humans to ever land on the moon. About six-and-a-half hours later, Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon on #ThisDayInHistory in 1969. Famously saying, That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”   The American effort to send astronauts to the moon had its origins in a famous appeal President John F. Kennedy made to Congress in 1961: “I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.” At the time, the U.S. was still trailing the Soviet Union in space developments. Despite the setbacks, NASA forged ahead.   At 9:32 a.m. on July 16, with the world watching, Apollo 11 took off from Kennedy Space Center with astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin Jr., and Michael Collins aboard. After traveling 240,000 miles in 76 hours, Apollo 11 entered into a lunar orbit on July 19. The next day, at 1:46 p.m., the lunar module Eagle, manned by Armstrong and Aldrin, separated from the command module, where Collins remained. Two hours later, the Eagle began its descent to the lunar surface, and at 4:18 p.m. the craft touched down on the southwestern edge of the Sea of Tranquility.

"30 years ago on #ThisDayInHistory, President George H.W. Bush signed the American with Disabilities Act into law. This act prohibited discrimination and aimed to ensure that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as every other American. The ADA was modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   After Congress introduced the ADA in 1988, conservative business interests kept the bill in limbo for a year and a half. The concern was that by forcing businesses to accommodate people with disabilities, the law would hurt those businesses. In March 1990, disability activists brought urgency to the issue by crawling up the steps of the Capitol, helping to push the bill forward into law. The protest was a striking visual image of the need for accessibility legislation. The youngest protestor, Jennifer Keelan of Denver, was just eight years old.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1862, the Second Confiscation and Militia Act was the first step toward the enlistment of African Americans in the Union Army.   Although it did not explicitly invite Black people to join the fight, it did authorize the president to “employ as many persons of African descent as he may deem necessary and proper for the suppression of this rebellion… in such manner as he may judge best for the public welfare.”   Some African Americans took this as their cue to begin forming infantry units of their own. Blacks from New Orleans formed three National Guard units: the First, Second, and Third Louisiana Native Guard. The First Kansas Colored Infantry fought in the October 1862 skirmish at Island Mound, Missouri. And the First South Carolina Infantry, African Descent went on its first expedition in November 1862.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1979, President Jimmy Carter addressed the nation via live television to discuss the nation’s energy crisis and accompanied recession.   Although the energy crisis and recession were the main topics of conversation, Carter heard from the attendees that Americans were also suffering from a deeper moral and spiritual crisis. This lack of “moral and spiritual confidence,” he concluded, was at the core of America’s inability to hoist itself out of its economic troubles. He also admitted that part of the problem was his failure to provide strong leadership on many issues, particularly energy and oil consumption.  Carter tried to rally the public to have faith in the future of America. After restoring faith in itself, the nation would be able to march on to the “the battlefield of energy [where] we can win for our nation a new confidence, and we can seize control again of our common destiny.”  Carter’s energy policy plans included the implementation of mandatory conservation efforts for individuals and businesses and deep cuts in the nation’s dependence on foreign oil through import quotas. He also pledged a “massive commitment of funds and resources” to develop alternative fuel sources including coal, plant products, and solar power. He outlined the creation of a “solar bank” that he said would eventually supply 20 percent of the nation’s energy.

Roosevelt, a Democrat, was the only U.S. president to serve more than two terms.  During his first term, Roosevelt enacted his New Deal social programs, which aimed at lifting America out of the Great Depression. In 1936, he won his second term in office. The president received some criticism for running again because there was an unwritten rule in American politics that no U.S. president should serve more than two terms. The custom dated back to George Washington who declined to run for his third term. Nevertheless, Roosevelt believed it was his duty to continue serving and lead his country through the mounting crisis in Europe.

"In 1862 on #ThisDayInHistory, African American journalist, abolitionist, and feminist who led an anti-lynching crusade, Ida B. Wells, is born.   Born a slave in Mississippi just six months before the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect, Wells wrote passionately about issues of race and politics in the South. A number of her articles were published in Black newspapers and periodicals under the moniker “Lola”.   On May 1884, Wells reached a personal turning point that resulted in her activism. After having bought a first-class train ticket, she was outraged when the train crew ordered her to move to the car for African Americans. She refused on principle. Wells sued the railroad, winning a $500 settlement in a circuit court case. The decision was later overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court. This injustice was among the events that led Wells to pick up a pen and write.  A lynching in Memphis incensed Wells and sparked an anti-lynching campaign in 1892. Wells wrote newspaper articles decrying the lynching of her friend and the wrongful deaths of other African Americans. Putting her own life at risk, she spent two months traveling in the South, gathering information on other lynching incidents.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1776, a 2,000-pound copper-and-tin bell, known as the Liberty Bell, rang out from the tower of Independence Hall, summoning citizens to the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence. The name “Liberty Bell” was first coined in an 1839 poem in an abolitionist pamphlet.   The Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly ordered a bell to be constructed in 1751 to commemorate the 50-year anniversary of Pennsylvania’s original constitution. After being cracked during a test, and then recast twice, the bell was hung from the State House steeple in June 1753. It was rung to call the Pennsylvania Assembly together and to summon people for special announcements and events.   The question of when the Liberty Bell acquired its famous fracture has been the subject of a good deal of historical debate. In 1846, the crack expanded to its present size while in use to mark Washington’s birthday. After that date, it was regarded as unsuitable for ringing, but it was still ceremoniously tapped on occasion to commemorate important events.

"In 1767 on #ThisDayInHistory, John Quincy Adams, son of the second U.S. president, John Adams, is born in Braintree, Massachusetts. John Quincy Adams inherited his father’s passion for politics. He accompanied his father on diplomatic missions from the time he was 14 and entered the legal profession after completing his schooling. In 1803, he began his first term as a Republican in the Senate and afterward helped negotiate the Treaty of Ghent that ended the War of 1812. In 1817, President James Monroe appointed Adams secretary of state, a position he held until 1824, when he ran for president. Adams won, and served one term as president, from 1825 to 1829.   After his presidency, he returned to congress. He preferred legislative duties to the presidency, which he described as the four most miserable years of his life. Beginning in 1831, he served in the U.S. House of Representatives, chairing congressional committees on the economy, Indian affairs and foreign relations. Adams argued the controversial Amistad slave ship case in the Supreme Court. He advocated on behalf of the enslaved Africans who had revolted and seized their ship; his arguments were successful and they were allowed to return to Africa.   On February 21, 1848, just after participating in a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives, Adams succumbed to a fatal stroke. He died two days later in a room in the Capitol building.

"Anne Frank and her family were forced to take refuge in a secret sealed-off area of an Amsterdam warehouse on #ThisDayInHistory in 1942.    As a Jewish family in Nazi-occupied Holland, Anne and her family feared deportation to a concentration camp.  Frank’s father Otto approached his Austrian-born bookkeeper, Miep Gies, and asked if she would help hide his family. Otto also asked his employees Johannes Kleiman, Victor Kugler, and Bep Voskuijl to help. They agreed and then risked their own lives to smuggle food, supplies, and news of the outside world into the so-called Secret Annex, whose entrance was hidden behind a movable bookcase.   On August 4, 1944, the Nazi Gestapo discovered the Frank’s “Secret Annex.” The Franks were sent to the Nazi concentration camps, along with two of the Christians who had helped shelter them.    After the war, Otto Frank returned to Amsterdam following his release from Auschwitz. Upon learning of Anne’s death, Miep Gies gave Otto five notebooks and some 300 loose papers containing Anne’s writings.

Faulkner joined the RAF in Canada after his high school sweetheart, Estelle, married another man. He quit his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi and headed to Canada.

Then Faulkner got a second chance with Estelle and they married in 1929.   His novels challenged conventional forms and were slow to catch on with the reading public.

After a fire destroyed much of the Palace of Westminster in October 1834, a standout feature of the design for the new palace was a large clock atop a tower.

While many clockmakers dismissed this goal as impossible, Airy counted on the help of Edmund Beckett Denison, a formidable barrister known for his expertise in horology, or the science of measuring time.  Even after an incendiary bomb destroyed the chamber of the House of Commons during the Second World War, Elizabeth Tower survived, and Big Ben continued to function.

"Nicholas II, the last czar of Russia, was neither trained nor inclined to rule, which did not help the autocracy he sought to preserve in an era desperate for change. Born in 1868, he succeeded to the Russian throne upon the death of his father, Czar Alexander III, in November 1894. That same month, the new czar married Alexandra, a German-born princess who came to have great influence over her husband. After a period of mourning for his late father, Nicholas and Alexandra were crowned czar and czarina in on #ThisDayinHistory 1896. -- As the ruler of Russia, Nicholas resisted calls for reform and sought to maintain czarist absolutism; although he lacked the strength of will necessary for such a task. The disastrous outcome of the Russo-Japanese War led to the Russian Revolution of 1905, which Nicholas only diffused. In 1914, Nicholas led his country into another costly war–World War I–and discontent grew as food became scarce, soldiers became war-weary, and devastating defeats at the hands of Germany demonstrated the ineffectiveness of Russia under Nicholas. -- In March 1917, the army garrison at Petrograd joined striking workers in demanding socialist reforms, and Nicholas II was called on to abdicate. By November 1917, the Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin seized power in Russia and set about establishing the world’s first communist state.

The Brooklyn Bridge, with its unprecedented length and two stately towers, was dubbed the “eighth wonder of the world.” The connection it provided between the massive population centers of Brooklyn and Manhattan changed the course of New York City forever. In 1898, the city of Brooklyn formally merged with New York City, Staten Island, and a few farm towns, forming Greater New York.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/CAkxlCEh-C4/,post_1568.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EpPT54l-uPcxH3Dx97x4-l6uskzqk1V0

"Four years after the United States won its independence from England, 55 state delegates, including George Washington, James Madison and Benjamin Franklin, convene in Philadelphia to compose a new U.S. constitution. On #ThisDayinHistory, 1787, delegates representing every state except Rhode Island convened at Philadelphia’s Pennsylvania State House for the Constitutional Convention. The building, which is now known as Independence Hall, had earlier seen the drafting of the Declaration of Independence and the signing of the Articles of Confederation. The assembly immediately discarded the idea of amending the Articles of Confederation and set about drawing up a new scheme of government. Revolutionary War hero George Washington, a delegate from Virginia, was elected convention president.  During three months of debate, the delegates devised a brilliant federal system characterized by an intricate system of checks and balances. The convention was divided over the issue of state representation in Congress, as more populated states sought proportional legislation, and smaller states wanted equal representation. The problem was resolved by the Connecticut Compromise, which proposed a bicameral legislature with proportional representation in the lower house (House of Representatives) and equal representation of the states in the upper house (Senate). On September 17, 1787, the Constitution of the United States of America was signed by 38 of the 41 delegates present at the conclusion of the convention. As dictated by Article VII, the document would not become binding until it was ratified by nine of the 13 states. On May 29, 1790, Rhode Island voted by two votes to ratify the document, and the last of the original 13 colonies joined the United States. Today the U.S. Constitution is the oldest written national constitution in operation in the world.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/CAnocsVB8O6/,post_1572.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1He9dDTSV9zspbIT08HREV3U-jHfPG6jW

"In the late 1580s, Queen Elizabeth’s support of the Dutch rebels in the Spanish Netherlands led King Philip II of Spain to plan the conquest of England. A giant Spanish invasion fleet was completed by 1587, but Sir Francis Drake’s daring raid on the port of Cadiz delayed the Armada’s departure until #ThisDayinHistory 1588. The Spanish Armada consisted of 130 ships and carried 2,500 guns and 30,000 men, two-thirds of them soldiers. Delayed by storms, the Armada did not reach the southern coast of England until late July. By that time the British were ready. — On July 21, the outnumbered English navy began bombarding the seven-mile-long line of Spanish ships from a safe distance, taking full advantage of their superior long-range guns. The Spanish Armada continued to advance during the next few days, but its ranks were thinned considerably by the English assault. The superior English guns proved mighty, and the Armada retreated north to Scotland. — Battered by storms and suffering from a lack of supplies, the Armada sailed on a difficult journey back to Spain through the North Sea and around Ireland. By the time the last of the surviving fleet reached Spain in October, half of the original armada was destroyed. Queen Elizabeth’s decisive defeat of the Invincible Armada made England a world-class naval power and introduced effective long-range weapons into naval warfare for the first time, ending the era of boarding and close-quarter fighting.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/CAYPOnnBqAL/,post_1578.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NSTaf7UdRbf4ivTY_YalUMA-WSYwHVuJ

"The United States conducts the first airborne test of an improved hydrogen bomb, dropping it from a plane over the tiny island of Namu in the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The successful test indicated that hydrogen bombs were viable airborne weapons and that the arms race had taken another giant leap forward. — The United States first detonated a hydrogen bomb in 1952 in the Marshall Islands, also in the Pacific. The practical application of dropping the weapon over an enemy had been a mere theoretical possibility until the successful test on #ThisDayinHistory 1956. This bomb was far more powerful than those previously tested. Observers said that the fireball caused by the explosion measured at least four miles in diameter and was brighter than the light from 500 suns. — The successful U.S. test meant that the ante in the nuclear arms race had been dramatically upped. The Soviets had tested their own hydrogen bomb in 1953, shortly after the first U.S. test in 1952. The massive open-air blast in 1956 caused concerns about the effects of such testing on human and animal life.

"In a major civil rights victory, the U.S. Supreme Court hands down an unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, ruling that racial segregation in public educational facilities is unconstitutional. The historic decision, which brought an end to federal tolerance of racial segregation, specifically dealt with Linda Brown, a young African American girl who had been denied admission to her local elementary school in Topeka, Kansas, because of the color of her skin.  In 1896, the Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that ""separate but equal"" accommodations in railroad cars conformed to the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection. That ruling was used to justify segregating all public facilities, including elementary schools. However, in the case of Linda Brown, the white school she attempted to attend was far superior to her black alternative and miles closer to her home. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) took up Linda’s cause, and in 1954 Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka reached the Supreme Court. African American lawyer (and future Supreme Court justice) Thurgood Marshall led Brown’s legal team, and on #ThisDayinHistory 1954, the high court handed down its decision.  In an opinion written by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the nation’s highest court ruled that not only was the “separate but equal” doctrine unconstitutional in Linda’s case, it was unconstitutional in all cases because educational segregation stamped an inherent badge of inferiority on African American students. A year later, after hearing arguments on the implementation of their ruling, the Supreme Court published guidelines requiring public school systems to integrate “with all deliberate speed.” Brown v. Board of Ed served to greatly motivate the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and ultimately led to the abolishment of racial segregation in all public facilities and accommodations.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/CAS3ewSh0Jm/,post_1581.jpg,

"A massive storm sends millions of tons of topsoil flying from across the parched Great Plains region of the United States as far east as New York, Boston and Atlanta on #ThisDayinHistory 1934. The U.S. entry into World War I in 1917 caused a great need for wheat, and farms began to push their fields to the limit, plowing under more and more grassland with the newly invented tractor. The plowing continued after the war, when the introduction of even more powerful gasoline tractors sped up the process. — In 1931, a severe drought spread across the region. As crops died, wind began to carry dust from the over-plowed and over-grazed lands. The number of dust storms reported jumped from 14 in 1932 to 28 in 1933. The following year, the storms decreased in frequency but increased in intensity, culminating in the most severe storm yet in May 1934. Over a period of two days, high-level winds caught and carried some 350 million tons of silt all the way from the northern Great Plains to the eastern seaboard. According to The New York Times, dust “lodged itself in the eyes and throats of weeping and coughing New Yorkers,” and even ships some 300 miles offshore saw dust collect on their decks. — Another massive storm on April 15, 1935–known as “Black Sunday”– brought even more attention to the desperate situation in the Great Plains region, which reporter Robert Geiger called the “Dust Bowl.” That year, as part of its New Deal program, President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration began to enforce federal regulation of farming methods, including crop rotation, grass-seeding and new plowing methods. This worked to a point, reducing dust storms by up to 65 percent, but only the end of the drought in the fall of 1939 would truly bring relief.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/CAD1YP9B7Vu/,post_1583.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1L_nWli597Z5FzhWIyxA0s4DT5GME-aG8

"One year after the United States doubled its territory with the Louisiana Purchase, the Lewis and Clark expedition leaves St. Louis, Missouri, on a mission to explore the Northwest from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean. Even before the U.S. government concluded purchase negotiations with France, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned his private secretary Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, an army captain, to lead an expedition into what is now the U.S. Northwest. On #ThisDayinHistory 1804, the “Corps of Discovery” left St. Louis for the American interior.  The expedition traveled up the Missouri River in a 55-foot long keelboat and two smaller boats. In November, Toussaint Charbonneau, a French-Canadian fur trader accompanied by his young Native American wife Sacagawea, joined the expedition as an interpreter. The group wintered in present-day North Dakota before crossing into present-day Montana, where they first saw the Rocky Mountains. On the other side of the Continental Divide, they were met by Sacagawea’s tribe, the Shoshone Indians, who sold them horses for their journey down through the Bitterroot Mountains. After passing through the dangerous rapids of the Clearwater and Snake rivers in canoes, the explorers reached the calm of the Columbia River, which led them to the sea. On November 8, 1805, the expedition arrived at the Pacific Ocean, the first European explorers to do so by an overland route from the east. After pausing there for the winter, the explorers began their long journey back to St. Louis.  On September 23, 1806, after almost two and a half years, the expedition returned to the city, bringing back a wealth of information about the largely unexplored region, as well as valuable U.S. claims to Oregon Territory.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/CALO8DWh9qL/,post_1585.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1iQa-KiZu6I7_XCpuMANrW2WszmpZuA8Q

Their tiny barbecue drive-in bore little resemblance to today’s ubiquitous “golden arches,” but it would eventually come to epitomize the fast-food industry, thanks to a pioneering system for food prep.  After World War II, the McDonald brothers discovered something surprising about their barbecue restaurant: 80 percent of their sales came from hamburgers. The brothers closed their doors and overhauled their business as a self-service restaurant where customers placed their orders at the windows.

"Today is International Nurses' Day, celebrated worldwide in honor of Florence Nightingale who was born 200 years ago on #ThisDayinHistory 1820. The British nurse, social reformer and statistician is best known as the founder of modern nursing. Her experiences as a nurse during the Crimean War were foundational in her views about sanitation. She established St. Thomas’ Hospital and the Nightingale Training School for Nurses in 1860. Her efforts to reform healthcare greatly influenced the quality of care in the 19 and 20 centuries.  When Nightingale traveled to Constantinople in the midst of the Crimean War, more soldiers were dying from infectious diseases like typhoid and cholera than from injuries incurred in battle. The no-nonsense Nightingale quickly set to work. In the evenings she moved through the dark hallways carrying a lamp while making her rounds, ministering to patient after patient. The soldiers, who were both moved and comforted by her endless supply of compassion, took to calling her “the Lady with the Lamp.” Others simply called her “the Angel of the Crimea.” Her work reduced the hospital’s death rate by two-thirds.  With the support of Queen Victoria, Nightingale helped create a Royal Commission into the health of the army.  It employed leading statisticians of the day to analyze army mortality data, and what they found was horrifying: 16,000 of the 18,000 deaths were from preventable diseases—not battle.  Poems, songs and plays were written and dedicated in the heroine’s honor. Young women aspired to be like her. Eager to follow her example, even women from the wealthy upper classes started enrolling at the training school. Thanks to Nightingale, nursing was no longer frowned upon by the upper classes; it had, in fact, come to be viewed as an honorable vocation. #InternationalNursesDay",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/CAFr0WoFsJG/,post_1594.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1w0wRTTCu38qKKraU7GZ0Go01IyKIJIDc

"Sitting Bull’s warriors had joined with other Indians in the Battle of the Little Big Horn in Montana, which resulted in the death of George Custer and five troops of the 7th Cavalry on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull and his followers managed to avoid a decisive confrontation with the U.S. Army. They spent the summer and winter after Little Big Horn hunting buffalo in Montana and fighting small skirmishes with soldiers. — In the fall of 1876, Colonel Nelson A. Miles met with Sitting Bull to talk him into surrendering and relocating to a reservation. Although anxious for peace, Sitting Bull refused. As the victor of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, Sitting Bull felt he should be dictating terms, not the other way around. Angered by what he saw as Sitting Bull’s foolish obstinacy, Miles stepped up his campaign of harassment against the chief and his people. Sitting Bull’s band continued to roam about Montana in search of increasingly scarce buffalo, but the constant travel, lack of food, and military pressure began to take a toll. On #ThisDayinHistory 1877, Sitting Bull abandoned his traditional homeland in Montana and led his people north across the border into Canada. — Sitting Bull and his band there for the next four years. The first year was idyllic. The band found plenty of buffalo and Sitting Bull could rest and play with his children in peace. The younger warriors, though, soon tired of the quiet life. The braves made trouble with neighboring tribes, attracting the displeasure of the Canadian Mounties. They became increasingly nervous and pressured Sitting Bull to return to the U.S. Sitting Bull relented and on July 10, 1881, he led 187 Indians from their Canadian refuge to the United States. After a period of confinement, Sitting Bull was assigned to the Standing Rock reservation in South Dakota in 1883.

"The airship Hindenburg, the largest dirigible ever built and the pride of Nazi Germany, bursts into flames upon touching its mooring mast in Lakehurst, New Jersey, killing 36 passengers and crew members on #ThisDayinHistory 1937. Large enough to carry substantial numbers of passengers, one of the most famous rigid airships was the Graf Zeppelin, a dirigible that traveled around the world in 1929. In the 1930s, the Graf Zeppelin pioneered the first transatlantic air service, leading to the construction of the Hindenburg, a larger passenger airship. — On May 3, 1937, the Hindenburg left Frankfurt, Germany, for a journey across the Atlantic to Lakehurst’s Navy Air Base. Stretching 804 feet from stern to bow, it carried 36 passengers and crew of 61. While attempting to moor at Lakehurst, the airship suddenly burst into flames, probably after a spark ignited its hydrogen core. Rapidly falling 200 feet to the ground, the hull of the airship incinerated within seconds. Thirteen passengers, 21 crewmen, and 1 civilian member of the ground crew lost their lives, and most of the survivors suffered substantial injuries. — Radio announcer Herb Morrison, who came to Lakehurst to record a routine voice-over for an NBC newsreel, immortalized the Hindenberg disaster in a famous on-the-scene description in which he emotionally declared, “Oh, the humanity!” The recording of Morrison’s commentary was immediately flown to New York, where it was aired as part of America’s first coast-to-coast radio news broadcast.

"Four Kent State University students were killed and nine were injured fifty years ago on #ThisDayinHistory 1970, when members of the Ohio National Guard opened fire on a crowd gathered to protest the Vietnam War. The tragedy was a watershed moment for a nation divided by the conflict in Southeast Asia. In its immediate aftermath, a student-led strike forced the temporary closure of colleges and universities across the country. Over just a 13-second period, nearly 70 shots were fired in total. In all, four Kent State students—Jeffrey Miller, Allison Krause, William Schroeder and Sandra Scheuer—were killed.  The popular protest song ""Ohio"", written by Neil Young and performed by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, was promptly recorded and received national airplay two-and-a-half weeks after the massacre.

Many believe it permanently changed the protest movement across the American political spectrum, fostering a sense of disillusionment regarding what, exactly, these demonstrations accomplish—as well as fears over the potential for confrontation between protesters and law enforcement.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_xj0o4Fe5V/,post_1601.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_y-0wMr7IN2asj3iffx90cAyaidYL5kk

"New immigrants to New York City in the late 1800s faced grim, cramped living conditions in tenement housing that once dominated the Lower East Side. Houses that were once for single families were divided to pack in as many people as possible. To keep up with the population increase, construction was done hastily and corners were cut. Tenement buildings were constructed with cheap materials, had little or no indoor plumbing and lacked proper ventilation. These cramped and often unsafe quarters left many vulnerable to rapidly spreading illnesses and disasters like fires. -- Jacob Riis, who immigrated to the United States in 1870, worked as a police reporter who focused largely on uncovering the conditions of these tenement slums. However, his leadership and legacy in social reform truly began when he started to use photography to reveal the dire conditions in the most densely populated city in America. His work appeared in books, newspapers and magazines and shed light on the atrocities of the city, leaving little to be ignored. -- In 1890, Riis compiled his work into his own book titled, How the Other Half Lives. As he wrote, ""every man’s experience ought to be worth something to the community from which he drew it, no matter what that experience may be.” The eye-opening images in the book caught the attention of then-Police Commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt. Riis' work would inspire Roosevelt and others to work to improve living conditions of poor immigrant neighborhoods.

The idea for a “Mother’s Day” is credited by some to Julia Ward Howe and by others to Anna Jarvis, who both suggested a holiday in honor of mothers and dedicated to peace. Many individual states celebrated Mother’s Day by 1911, but it was not until Wilson lobbied Congress in 1914 that Mother’s Day was officially set on the second Sunday of every May.

Cities in both nations, as well as formerly occupied cities in Western Europe, put out flags and banners, rejoicing in the defeat of the Nazi war machine. — As news of the official surrender spread on May 7, relieved and exhausted citizens poured into the streets of London to welcome the war’s end. Though British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and King George VI wanted May 7 to be celebrated as V-E Day, they acquiesced to their American allies and declared an official celebration on May 8. Paris exploded into celebration where crowds of people dashed through the Arc de Triomphe waving the Allied flags, and British, American and French servicemen celebrated along with the crowds of civilians throughout the night. New York’s Times Square swelled with throngs of people upon news of the surrender, and other celebrations took place in cities across the nation. — The German surrender shifted the focus of World War II to Washington, as the United States was the major world power with the greatest participation (by far) in the war against Japan.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_75nkOl4F9/,post_1610.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1da1tEInT3ook71qaljm6FgvQ0sSikzJ5

"President Herbert Hoover officially dedicates New York City’s Empire State Building, pressing a button from the White House that turns on the building’s lights on #ThisDayinHistory 1931. Hoover’s gesture, of course, was symbolic; while the president remained in Washington, D.C., someone else flicked the switches in New York. — The idea for the Empire State Building is said to have been born of a competition between Walter Chrysler of the Chrysler Corporation and John Jakob Raskob of General Motors, to see who could erect the taller building. The Art-Deco plans, rumored to have been based in large part on the look of a pencil, were also builder-friendly: The entire building went up in just over a year, under budget (at $40 million) and well ahead of schedule. During certain periods of building, the frame grew an astonishing four-and-a-half stories a week. — At the time of its completion, the Empire State Building, at 102 stories and 1,250 feet high (1,454 feet to the top of the lightning rod), was the world’s tallest skyscraper. The Depression-era construction employed as many as 3,400 workers on any single day, most of whom received an excellent pay rate, especially given the economic conditions of the time. The new building imbued New York City with a deep sense of pride, desperately needed in the depths of the Great Depression, when many city residents were unemployed and prospects looked bleak.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_p_QwXlF0V/,post_1612.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1uglyK1rY-2Sdnf4eKegbz1JjazozoZhO
"John Wilkes Booth will forever be known as the man who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. Booth, a native of Maryland, was a fierce Confederate sympathizer during the Civil War. Before the fateful night at Ford’s Theatre, he had conspired to kidnap Lincoln and hide him until all Confederate prisoners were released. On April 14, 1865, Booth entered the theater’s balcony, shot Lincoln at close range and immediately fled the scene. Many in the audience recognized Booth, so the army was soon hot on his trail. Booth and his accomplice, David Herold, made their way across the Anacostia River and headed toward southern Maryland. The pair stopped at Dr. Samuel Mudd’s home, and Mudd treated Booth’s leg. Booth found refuge for several days at the home of Thomas A. Jones, a Confederate agent, before securing a boat to row across the Potomac to Virginia.  The countryside was swarming with military units looking for Booth, although few shared information since there was a $20,000 reward. While staying at the farm of Richard Garrett, Federal troops arrived on their search but soon rode on. The unsuspecting Garrett allowed his suspicious guests to sleep in his barn, but he instructed his son to lock the barn from the outside to prevent the strangers from stealing his horses. A tip led the Union soldiers back to the Garrett farm, where they discovered Booth and Herold in the barn. Herold came out, but Booth refused. The building was set on fire to flush Booth, but he was shot while still inside. He lived for three hours before gazing at his hands, muttering “Useless, useless,” as he died on #ThisDayinHistory 1865.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_c3w8elYFZ/,post_1613.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1mB0Aj2cVgvgTtAXg9f8c8Nq9bc4j5Vrx
"Historians believe Shakespeare was born on #ThisDayinHistory 1564, the same day he died in 1616. Although the plays of William Shakespeare may be the most widely read works in the English language, little is known for certain about the playwright himself. Some scholars even believe the plays were not written by William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon but by some other well-educated, aristocratic writer who wished to remain anonymous. — He became a member of the popular theater group the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, who later became the King’s Men. The group built and operated the famous Globe Theater in 1599. Shakespeare ultimately became a major shareholder in the troupe and earned enough money to buy a large house in Stratford in 1597. He retired to Stratford in 1610, where he wrote his last plays, including The Tempest and The Winter’s Tale. Meanwhile, he had written more than 100 sonnets, which were published in 1609. Although pirated versions of Titus Andronicus, Romeo and Juliet and some other plays were published during Shakespeare’s lifetime, no definitive collection of his works was published until after his death. In 1623, two members of Shakespeare’s troupe collected the plays and printed what is now called the First Folio.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_U_uKCFfhi/,post_1614.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15YfaOSgklyQfa2_ycu_wHdqPm_rsfg-e
"The modern legend of the Loch Ness Monster is born when a sighting makes local news on #ThisDayinHistory 1933. The newspaper Inverness Courier relates an account of a local couple who claim to have seen “an enormous animal rolling and plunging on the surface.” The story of the “monster” (a moniker chosen by the Courier editor) becomes a media phenomenon, with London newspapers sending correspondents to Scotland and a circus offering a 20,000 pound sterling reward for capture of the beast. -- Amateur investigators have for decades kept an almost constant vigil, and in the 1960s several British universities launched sonar expeditions to the lake. Nothing conclusive was found, but in each expedition the sonar operators detected some type of large, moving underwater objects. In 1975, another expedition combined sonar and underwater photography in Loch Ness. A photo resulted that, after enhancement, appeared to show what vaguely resembled the giant flipper of an aquatic animal. -- Further sonar expeditions in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in more inconclusive readings. Revelations in 1994 that the famous 1934 photo was a complete hoax has only slightly dampened the enthusiasm of tourists and investigators for the legendary beast of Loch Ness.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_sLAsnFlKL/,post_1615.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NitMny8WkP4zxKEkcgLUzOc9dD5B4udh
"In the first year of Winston Churchill's administration, Britain stood alone against Nazi Germany, but he promised his country and the world that the British people would “never surrender.” He rallied the British populace to a resolute resistance and expertly orchestrated Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin into an alliance that eventually crushed the Axis. In July 1945, 10 weeks after Germany’s defeat, Churchill's Conservative government suffered an electoral loss against Clement Attlee’s Labour Party, and Churchill resigned as prime minister. He became leader of the opposition and in 1951 was again elected prime minister. Two years later, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature for his six-volume historical study of World War II and for his political speeches.

"Hiram Ulysses Grant was born on #ThisDayinHistory 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio to Jesse and Hannah Simpson Grant. The congressman who supported Grant's admission to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point mistakenly believed his first name was Ulysses and his middle name was Simpson (his mother’s maiden name) so he became known as Ulysses S. Grant. After graduating from West Point, where he was as a skilled horseman but an otherwise undistinguished student, Grant saw action in the Mexican-American War. After the onset of the Civil War in 1861, Grant became a colonel of the 21st Illinois Volunteers. After some early successes in battle, President Abraham Lincoln made Grant a brigadier general. In July 1863, Grant’s forces captured Vicksburg, Mississippi, a Confederate stronghold. Grant was appointed lieutenant general by Lincoln in 1864 and given command of all U.S. armies. He led a series of campaigns that ultimately helped bring the deadliest conflict in U.S. history to a close. Grant became a national hero, and in 1866 was appointed America’s first four-star general. Republicans nominated Grant as their presidential candidate, and he went on to win the 1868 election. A primary focus of Grant’s administration was Reconstruction/ He worked to reconcile the North and South while also attempting to protect the civil rights of African Americans. While Grant was personally honest, some of his associates were corrupt and his administration was tarnished by various scandals. Grant signed legislation establishing the Department of Justice, the Weather Bureau and Yellowstone National Park, America’s first national park. In late 1884, he was diagnosed with throat cancer. Grant died on July 23, 1885, in Mount McGregor, New York, in the Adirondacks, where he and his family were spending the summer. His memoirs, published that same year by his friend Mark Twain, became a major financial success. More than a million people gathered in New York City to witness Grant’s funeral procession. The former president was laid to rest in a tomb in New York City.

The government refused to pay due to a lack of proof that the demand was genuine. Then on #ThisDayinHistory 1994, “The Scream” is recovered undamaged at a hotel in Asgardstrand, about 40 miles south of Oslo. — Eventually, police found four pieces of the painting’s frame in Nittedal, a suburb north of Oslo, and what may have been a cryptic messages that the thieves wanted to discuss a ransom. Finally, in January 1996, four men were convicted and sentenced in connection with the theft. They included Paal Enger, who had been convicted in 1988 of stealing Munch’s “The Vampire” in Oslo.

A White man threw stones at Williams, hit him, and caused him to drown. When police officers arrived on the scene, they refused to arrest the White man who Black eyewitnesses pointed to as the responsible party.   This sparked a week of rioting between Black and White Chicagoans in the South Side neighborhood. After police were unable to quell the riots, the state militia was called in on the fourth today.

In the aftermath of the rioting, city officials organized the Chicago Commission on Race Relations to look into the root causes of the riots and find ways to combat them.

Situated on the outskirts of the town of Dachau, about 10 miles northwest of Munich in 1933, the camp initially held thousands of political prisoners, consisting primarily of German communists, Social Democrats, and other political opponents of the Nazi regime. During the next few years, the number of prisoners grew dramatically, and other groups were interned at Dachau, including Jehovah’s Witnesses, Gypsies, homosexuals, and repeat criminals. Beginning in 1938, Jews began to comprise a major portion of camp internees. Prisoners at Dachau were used as forced laborers, initially in the construction and expansion of the camp and later for German armaments production. — During the entire time in which Dachau served as a concentration camp and death camp, over 200,000 prisoners were cataloged as having passed through its gates.

"Titanic created quite a stir when it departed for its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912. After stops in Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (Cobh), Ireland, the ship set sail for New York with 2,240 passengers and crew. As befitting the first transatlantic crossing of the world’s most celebrated ship, many of the souls onboard were high-ranking officials, wealthy industrialists, dignitaries and celebrities. But by far the largest group of passengers was in Third Class: more than 700, exceeding the other two levels combined. Some had paid less than $20 to make the crossing. —— Just before midnight on April 14, the Titanic failed to divert its course from an iceberg and ruptured at least five of its hull compartments. These compartments filled with water and pulled down the bow of the ship. Because the Titanic‘s compartments were not capped at the top, water from the ruptured compartments filled each succeeding compartment, causing the bow to sink and the stern to be raised up to an almost vertical position above the water. Then the Titanic broke in half, and, at about 2:20 a.m. on #ThisDayinHistory 1912, stern and bow sank to the ocean floor. Due to a shortage of lifeboats and the lack of satisfactory emergency procedures, more than 1,500 people went down in the sinking ship or froze to death in the icy North Atlantic waters.

"“Listen, my children, and you shall hear of the midnight ride of Paul Revere” begins the famous poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, “Paul Revere’s Ride.” In the early 1770s, Paul Revere, a colonial Boston silversmith, industrialist, and patriot, became active politically as unrest was sparking in the colonies in response to British taxes. Revere began work as a courier and rode from Boston to New York on horse to spread information about what was happening in the colonies. -- When his associates learned the British were moving troops out of Boston and planned to arrest revolutionary leaders Samuel Adams and John Hancock in Lexington, Revere was tasked with tipping them off to help them avoid arrest. He first used his signal system and had two lanterns placed on the Old North Church steeple in Boston to alert those on the harbor that the troops had left Boston and were crossing the Charles River. Then, at about 10 p.m. on #ThisDayinHistory 1775, Revere set out in the dark from his North Boston home by horse with two other riders to reach Adams and Hancock. The riders met the pair in Lexington and enabled the revolutionaries to avoid arrest. Revere’s next stop that late night was Concord, Massachusetts, a hotbed of the resistance. But Revere was captured by the British en route and never reached Concord. He was soon released, but Revere had already helped give the colonial militia a key advantage. The Battles of Lexington and Concord would help spark the Revolutionary War. -- Revere later became an American folk hero about 100 years later because of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s poem, written in 1860. It depicts a dangerous, midnight ride as Revere warns the colonists about the British attack. The poem recounts his lantern signal system in the lines “one if by land, two if by sea.” The riveting poem made him an American hero, and while it contains historical inaccuracies, such as claiming Revere rode alone, the poem highlights the risks taken by this patriot at the start of the American Revolution.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_INwjCBFY6/,post_1625.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GDpnn1fRT-AioMFk5m6CTG0GqEkDoehm

"Charlie Chaplin, born on #ThisDayinHistory 1889, became one of the most financially successful stars of early Hollywood. Chaplin was introduced to the stage when he was five. The son of London music hall entertainers, young Chaplin was watching a show starring his mother when her voice cracked. He was quickly shuffled onto the stage to finish the act. His father died when Chaplin was a toddler, and when his mother had a nervous breakdown Chaplin and his older half-brother, Sydney, roamed London, where they danced on the streets and collected pennies in a hat. Soon, Chaplin’s bowler hat, out-turned feet, mustache and walking cane became his trademark which he refined and would soon become his legacy, the character Charlie the Tramp. A masterful silent film actor and pantomimist who could elicit both laughter and tears from his audiences. In 1918, he signed a contract with First National for a whopping $1 million for eight films. The following year, Chaplin founded United Artists Corporation along with Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and director D.W. Griffith. —— Though he had lived in the United States for 42 years, Chaplin never became a U.S. citizen. A vocal pacifist, Chaplin was accused of communist ties, which he denied. Nevertheless, in 1952, immigration officials prevented Chaplin and his wife from re-entering the United States after a foreign tour. The couple did not return to the United States for 20 years; instead they settled in Switzerland with their eight children.

"One of the leading figures of early American history, Benjamin Franklin was a statesman, author, publisher, scientist, inventor and diplomat. Born into a Boston family of modest means, Franklin had little formal education. He went on to start a printing business in Philadelphia and became successful. He published classics including ""Poor Richard's Almanack"" from 1733 to 1758. Franklin was deeply active in public affairs in his adopted city, where he helped launch a lending library, hospital and college and garnered acclaim for his experiments with electricity, among other projects. During the American Revolution, he served in the Second Continental Congress and helped draft the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Franklin was a diplomat who helped broker French support for the Revolutionary cause and also negotiated the 1783 Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War. Franklin was an early abolitionist who advocated for an end to slavery.  In his final significant act of public service, he was a delegate to the convention that produced the U.S. Constitution in 1787. After his death on #ThisDayinHistory 1790, Philadelphia gave him the largest funeral the city had ever seen.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_FoKUdFJOe/,post_1631.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=19HrAUcqUUCFS-Ep7tTMtACAu_1b1zvrv

"Earth Day was first celebrated fifty years ago on #ThisDayinHistory 1970 as a day of education about environmental issues. The holiday is now a global celebration that’s sometimes extended into Earth Week, a full seven days of events focused on green living. Earth Day began as a “national teach-in on the environment” and was held on April 22 to maximize the number of students that could be reached on university campuses.  Since 1970, Earth Day celebrations have grown. In 1990, Earth Day went global, with 200 million people in over 140 nations participating, according to the Earth Day Network (EDN), a nonprofit organization that coordinates Earth Day activities. In 2000, Earth Day focused on clean energy and involved hundreds of millions of people in 184 countries and 5,000 environmental groups.

"Fifty years ago on #ThisDayinHistory 1970,  Apollo 13, the third lunar landing mission, is successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, carrying astronauts James A. Lovell, John L. Swigert and Fred W. Haise. The spacecraft’s destination was the Fra Mauro highlands of the moon, where the astronauts were to explore the Imbrium Basin and conduct geological experiments. — Two days later on April 13 at 9:08 p.m., the No. 2 oxygen tank blew up, disabling the normal supply of oxygen, electricity, light, and water. Lovell reported to mission control: “Houston, we’ve had a problem here.” Lovell looked out of the left-hand window and saw that the spacecraft was venting a gas, which turned out to be the Command Module’s (CM) oxygen. The landing mission was aborted. — For the next three days, Lovell, Haise and Swigert huddled in the freezing lunar module. Haise developed a case of the flu. Mission control spent this time frantically trying to develop a procedure that would allow the astronauts to restart the CM for reentry. On April 17, a last-minute navigational correction was made,  using Earth as an alignment guide. Then the re-pressurized CM was successfully powered up after its long, cold sleep. The heavily damaged service module was shed, and one hour before re-entry the LM was disengaged from the CM. Just before 1 p.m., the spacecraft reentered Earth’s atmosphere. After four minutes of radio silence Apollo 13‘s parachutes were spotted, and the astronauts splashed down safely into the Pacific Ocean.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-143oBhnU-/,post_1635.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1P713xD7Op2GVTb6JDkqkplfvQSg--a-Z
"Emiliano Zapata, a leader of peasants and indigenous people during the Mexican Revolution, is ambushed and shot to death in Morelos by government forces on #ThisDayinHistory 1919. — Born a peasant in 1879, Zapata was forced into the Mexican army in 1908 following his attempt to recover village lands taken over by a rancher. After the revolution began in 1910, he raised an army of peasants in the southern state of Morelos under the slogan “Land and Liberty.” Demanding simple agrarian reforms, Zapata and his guerrilla farmers opposed the central Mexican government under Francisco Madero, later under Victoriano Huerta, and finally under Venustiano Carranza. Zapata and his followers never gained control of the central Mexican government, but they redistributed land and aided poor farmers within the territory under their control. — Zapata’s influence has endured long after his death, and his agrarian reform movement, known as zapatismo, remains important to many Mexicans today. In 1994, a guerrilla group calling themselves the Zapata Army of National Liberation launched a peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-zVOrcBN8c/,post_1636.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=144kFlIKuDmjfcA0ye9-p4C-GCmFi9ZAC
"In Appomattox Court House, Virginia, Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrenders his 28,000 troops to Union General Ulysses S. Grant, effectively ending the American Civil War on #ThisDayinHistory 1865. Lee had been forced to abandon the Confederate capital of Richmond and was blocked from joining the surviving Confederate force in North Carolina. — In retreating from the Union army’s Appomattox Campaign, the Army of Northern Virginia had stumbled through the Virginia countryside stripped of food and supplies. At one point, Union cavalry forces under General Philip Sheridan had outrun Lee’s army, blocking their retreat and taking 6,000 prisoners at Sayler’s Creek. Desertions were mounting daily, and by April 8 the Confederates were surrounded. On April 9, Lee sent a message to Grant announcing his willingness to surrender. The two generals met in the parlor of the Wilmer McLean home at one o’clock in the afternoon. — Lee and Grant, both holding the highest rank in their respective armies, had known each other slightly during the Mexican War and exchanged awkward personal inquiries. Grant arrived in his muddy field uniform while Lee had turned out in full dress attire, complete with sash and sword. Lee asked for the terms, and Grant hurriedly wrote them out. All officers and men were to be pardoned, and they would be sent home with their private property–most important, the horses, which could be used for a late spring planting. Officers would keep their side arms, and Lee’s starving men would be given Union rations. — Shushing a band that had begun to play in celebration, General Grant told his officers, “The war is over. The Rebels are our countrymen again.” Although scattered resistance continued for several weeks, for all practical purposes the Civil War had come to an end.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-xCVkqh0J2/,post_1637.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1BdK_S7Xafict-as6HqZ3X84GNcPlEyUw
"Today is #NationalSiblingsDay. Throughout history, many siblings have made positive change, but others, like Frank and Jesse James, have been notoriously destructive. They are pictured here in 1870 with their mother, Zerelda Elizabeth Cole James Simms Samuel. For 16 years, Jesse James and his brother, Frank, committed robberies and murders throughout the Midwest.  The two Missouri brothers drifted into a life of crime after serving in Confederate guerrilla forces during the Civil War. They began robbing banks in 1866. Detective magazines and pulp novels glamorized the James gang, turning them into mythical Robin Hoods who were driven to crime by unethical landowners and bankers. In reality, the James gang were ruthless killers out for themselves. After the brothers murdered two innocent men during an 1881 train robbery, the state of Missouri offered a reward of $5,000 each for the capture of Jesse and Frank. Shot down for reward money in 1882 by one of his own gang members, Jesse achieved a false but enduring reputation as a martyr in the cause of the common people against powerful interests. ​Frank died in the room in which he was born on his family farm, in 1915.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-0CzithQe-/,post_1638.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1XKHvwZCsqEzPqda2b3886VCZ6gWPL4u5
"On a clear spring day 75 years ago on #ThisDayinHistory, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sat in the living room at his Warm Springs, Georgia retreat with Lucy Mercer, two cousins and his dog Fala, while the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff painted his portrait. Around 1 p.m. he suddenly complained of a pain in the back of his head and collapsed unconscious. — One of the women summoned a doctor, who recognized the symptoms of a massive cerebral hemorrhage and gave the president a shot of adrenaline into the heart to  try to revive him. Mercer and Shoumatoff quickly left the house, expecting FDR’s family to arrive as soon as word got out. Another doctor phoned first lady Eleanor Roosevelt in Washington, D.C., informing her that FDR had fainted. She told the doctor she would travel to Georgia that evening after delivering a speech. By 3:30 p.m., though, doctors in Warm Springs had pronounced the president dead. — Eleanor delivered her speech that afternoon and was listening to a piano performance when she was summoned back to the White House. In her memoirs, she recalled that ride to the White House as one of dread, as she knew in her heart that her husband had died. At 5:30 pm, she greeted Vice President Truman. A calm and quiet Eleanor said, “Harry, the president is dead.” He asked if there was anything he could do for her, to which she replied, “Is there anything we can do for you? For you are the one in trouble now.” Indeed, Truman had rather large shoes to fill. FDR had presided over the Great Depression and most of World War II, leaving an indelible stamp on American politics. — Eleanor threw herself into FDR’s funeral preparations. Thousands of Americans lined the tracks to bid Roosevelt farewell while a slow train carried his coffin from Warm Springs to Washington, D.C.

"75 years ago on #ThisDayinHistory 1945, the American Third Army liberates the Buchenwald concentration camp, near Weimar, Germany. Jews had been brought to the camps and its many sub-camps from throughout Europe since it was opened in July 1937. Prisoners also included those who were mentally and physically disabled, political prisoners and Romanis. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of prisoners died monthly from disease, malnutrition, beatings and executions. Doctors performed medical experiments on inmates, testing the effects of viral infections and vaccines. Knowing that the U.S. forces were approaching, the Germans started to evacuate prisoners from the camp in early April. In an act of resistance, emaciated prisoners took control of the camp on April 11. U.S. forces liberated over 21,000 people from the camp.

"Margaret Thatcher, the first female prime minister of the United Kingdom - nicknamed the Iron Lady - was credited by her admirers with championing free-market, policies that revitalized the British economy, while critics charged these initiatives hurt the nation’s poor and working class. Serving from 1979 to 1990, Thatcher was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century. She curbed the power of Britain’s labor unions, privatized state-owned industries, led her nation to victory in the Falklands War and as a close ally of U.S. President Ronald Reagan played a pivotal role in ending the Cold War. When she departed 10 Downing Street, Thatcher was the longest continuously serving prime minister in more than 150 years. She went on to pen her memoirs and travel the world giving lectures. Following a series of minor strokes in the early 2000s, Thatcher largely retreated from public view. Meryl Streep earned an Oscar for her portrayal of the former prime minister in the 2011 biopic “The Iron Lady,” which generated criticism from some Conservative politicians for its depiction of Thatcher’s decline into dementia during her later years.  Margaret Thatcher died in London at age 87 from a stroke on #ThisDayinHistory 2013.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-uR4ImBt2B/,post_1642.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1OLFs58caPQOmXcvs5R06tDlfEvr0L3LJ
"150 years ago on #ThisDayinHistory 1870 the Metropolitan Museum of Art is officially incorporated in New York City. The brainchild of American expatriates in Paris and a number of wealthy New Yorkers, the Met would not put on an exhibition until 1872, but it quickly blossomed into one of the world’s premier repositories of fine art, a position it holds to this day. — The Met acquired its first object, a Roman sarcophagus, the following November. Its subsequent purchase of the Cesnola Collection of Cypriot Art, completed in 1876, made the Met North America’s premier destination for artifacts and artwork from Antiquity. Thanks in part to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Jay was able to acquire a stunning 174 pieces by the Dutch Old Masters in 1871, giving the museum a substantial collection by the time it opened at its first location in 1872. In 1880, ten years after its founding, the Met moved to its current location on Fifth Avenue at 82 Street. The Met continues to display some of the world’s largest collections of European and Antique art, and has expanded to include works from every continent and nearly every medium. Today, the Met is not only one of the leading artistic and social institutions in New York but one of the best-known and most-visited museums in the world, hosting around 7 million visitors a year. @metmuseum",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-7QeYnBCHS/,post_1643.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lOM30seyIlHyxTrt5MePpknJSqCQwc_S
"On the evening of Good Friday on #ThisDayinHistory 1865, Abraham Lincoln and his wife Mary Todd attend Laura Keene’s acclaimed performance in Our American Cousin at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C. In the middle of act two, actor John Wilkes Booth entered Lincoln’s private theater box unnoticed, and shot the president with a single bullet in the back of his head. Booth jumped onto the stage, breaking his left leg, and shouted, “Sic semper tyrannis! (Ever thus to tyrants!) The South is avenged,” then quickly fled on horseback and escaped Washington.  The president, mortally wounded, was carried to a lodging house opposite Ford’s Theater. An hour after dawn the next morning around 7:22 a.m., Abraham Lincoln died, becoming the first president to be assassinated. His body was taken to the White House, where it lay until April 18, at which point it was carried to the Capitol rotunda to lay in state on a catafalque. On April 21, Lincoln’s body was taken to the railroad station and boarded on a train that conveyed it to Springfield, Illinois, his home before becoming president. Tens of thousands of Americans lined the train’s railroad route and paid their respects to their fallen leader during the train’s solemn progression through the North. Lincoln was buried on May 4, 1865, at Oak Ridge Cemetery, near Springfield. — Booth, pursued by the army and secret service forces, was finally cornered in a barn near Bowling Green, Virginia. Booth remained in the barn as it went up in flames and was then shot and killed by Corporal Boston Corbett.

"On #ThisDayinHistory 1961, President John F. Kennedy sends a letter to Congress in which he recommends the U.S. participate in an international campaign to preserve ancient temples and historic monuments in the Nile Valley of Egypt. The campaign, initiated by UNESCO, was designed to save sites threatened by the construction of the Aswan High Dam. JFK believed that America’s participation in the project would reflect “the interests of the United States,” as well as the country’s interest in ancient Egyptian culture “from which many of our own cultural traditions have sprung” and the U.S.’s “deep friendship for the people who live in the valley of the Nile.” Kennedy possessed a personal interest in the sciences and history and, from the beginning of his presidency, set out to promote American scholarship in these areas. His administration also wanted to develop diplomatic ties with the Arab nations in the Middle East and North Africa. In 1961, the total cost of preserving Egypt’s historic sites was estimated at $100 million; the U.S. contributed a total of $16 million toward the effort, which was used to help protect ruins from water re-routed for the dam or to relocate antiquities. Kennedy, assassinated in 1963, did not live to see any of the precious antiquities arrive in America. His widow, however, former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, helped arrange to have Eqypt’s Temple of Dendur brought to New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1965.

"On #ThisDayInHistory in 1974, the House Judiciary Committee recommended that America’s 37th president, Richard Nixon, be impeached and removed from office. The impeachment proceedings resulted from a series of political scandals involving the Nixon administration that came to be collectively known as Watergate.   In July 1973, one of Nixon’s former staff members revealed the existence of secretly taped conversations between the president and his aides. Nixon initially refused to release the tapes, on grounds of executive privilege and national security, but a judge later ordered the president to turn them over.  The House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon, making him the second U.S. president (after Johnson) to face a potential trial before the Senate. On August 8, Nixon announced his resignation, becoming the first president in U.S. history to voluntarily leave office early.

After four centuries of active use, the magnificent arena fell into neglect, and up until the 18th century it was used as a source of building materials.

"Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th president of the United States and one of the most highly regarded American generals of World War II. Born in Denison, Texas, in 1890, Eisenhower graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1915, and after World War I he steadily rose in the peacetime ranks of the U.S. Army. After the U.S. entrance into World War II, he was appointed commanding general of the European theater of operations and oversaw U.S. troops massing in Great Britain. As supreme commander of a mixed force of Allied nationalities, services, and equipment, Eisenhower designed a system of unified command and rapidly won the respect of his British and Canadian subordinates. From North Africa, he successfully directed the invasions of Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy, and in January 1944 was appointed supreme Allied commander of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of northwestern Europe.  After the war, he briefly served as president of Columbia University before returning to military service in 1951 as supreme commander of the combined land and air forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Pressure on Eisenhower to run for U.S. president was great, however, and in the spring of 1952 he relinquished his NATO command to run for president on the Republican ticket. In November 1952, “Ike” won a resounding victory in the presidential elections and in 1956 was reelected in a landslide. A popular president, he oversaw a period of great economic growth in the United States and deftly navigated the country through increasing Cold War tension on the world stage. In 1961, he retired with his wife, Mamie Doud Eisenhower, to his farm in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

"President Harry S. Truman signs the Economic Assistance Act, commonly known as the Marshall Plan, on #ThisDayinHistory 1948, which authorized the creation of a program that would help the nations of Europe recover and rebuild after the devastation wrought by World War II. The plan aimed to stabilize Europe economically and politically so that European nations would not be tempted by the appeal of communist parties. U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall made his famous call for American assistance to Europe in a speech at Harvard University on June 5, 1947. He proposed that the European states themselves draw up a program for economic recovery, which the United States would help fund. Marshall himself said, “Our policy is not directed against any country, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos."" Under the Marshall Plan, the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) distributed $13 billion in aid over four years (1948-51). Most of the funds were given in direct grants, and the rest in loans.

"Two months after the signing of the Vietnam peace agreement, the last U.S. combat troops leave South Vietnam as Hanoi frees the remaining American prisoners of war held in North Vietnam. America’s direct eight-year intervention in the Vietnam War was at an end. In Saigon, some 7,000 U.S. Department of Defense civilian employees remained behind to aid South Vietnam in conducting what looked to be a fierce and ongoing war with communist North Vietnam. In January 1973, representatives of the United States, North and South Vietnam, and the Vietcong signed a peace agreement in Paris, ending the direct U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War. Its key provisions included a cease-fire throughout Vietnam, the withdrawal of U.S. forces, the release of prisoners of war, and the reunification of North and South Vietnam through peaceful means. The South Vietnamese government was to remain in place until new elections were held, and North Vietnamese forces in the South were not to advance further nor be reinforced. In reality, however, the agreement was little more than a face-saving gesture by the U.S. government. Even before the last American troops departed on #ThisDayinHistory 1973, the communists violated the cease-fire, and by early 1974 full-scale war had resumed. At the end of 1974, South Vietnamese authorities reported that 80,000 of their soldiers and civilians had been killed in fighting during the year, making it the most costly of the Vietnam War.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Ujyd0hrVL/,post_1653.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Zl7Zt3HMeRiQI3XM4DAz-XGwzOb1srV5

Though it resulted in an Allied victory, kamikaze fighters, rainy weather and fierce fighting on land, sea and air led to a large death toll on both sides. Winning the Battle of Okinawa put Allied forces within striking distance of Japan. But wanting to bring the war to a swift end, and knowing over 2 million Japanese troops were awaiting battle-weary American soldiers, Harry S. Truman chose to drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6. Japan didn’t give in immediately, so Truman ordered the bombing of Nagasaki on August 9. Finally, Japan had had enough. On August, 14, 1945, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan’s surrender, marking the end of World War II.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-cVgNYBd2D/,post_1656.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1JWWYmRXj9H6_m-kaJPR9_YDp4KULbJbS
"The “Twin Towers” of the World Trade Center officially open in New York City on #ThisDayinHistory 1973. The buildings replaced the Empire State Building as the world’s tallest building. The towers’ construction ended the Empire State Building’s 41-year run as the tallest building in the world, and quickly replaced by Chicago’s Sears Tower the following year, an indication of the rising trend of super-tall construction. The World Trade Center dramatically altered the New York skyline and the cityscape of Lower Manhattan. Though most of the World Trade Center was occupied by office space, the Top of the World Observation Deck on the South Tower became a popular tourist destination, as did the North Tower’s Windows on the World restaurant, which featured its own wine school. The Twin Towers remained a dominant feature of the city’s skyline and were recognizable the world over long before they were destroyed in a terrorist attack on September 11, 2001.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-kgZVBBaSr/,post_1657.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AhB6Tb4P4KT9r_Z0rrJsl1S5NQcM6PZZ

"On #ThisDayinHistory 1889, the Eiffel Tower is dedicated in Paris in a ceremony presided over by Gustave Eiffel, the tower’s designer, and attended by French Prime Minister Pierre Tirard, a handful of other dignitaries, and 200 construction workers. In 1889, to honor of the centenary of the French Revolution, the French government planned an international exposition and announced a design competition for a monument to be built on the Champ-de-Mars in central Paris. The Centennial Committee chose Eiffel’s plan of an open-lattice wrought-iron tower that would reach almost 1,000 feet above Paris and be the world’s tallest man-made structure. Eiffel, a noted bridge builder, was a master of metal construction and designed the framework of the Statue of Liberty that had recently been erected in New York Harbor. Eiffel’s tower was greeted with skepticism from critics who argued that it would be structurally unsound, and indignation from others who thought it would be an eyesore in the heart of Paris. Unperturbed, Eiffel completed his great tower under budget in just two years. Only one worker lost his life during construction, which at the time was a remarkably low casualty number for a project of that magnitude. The light, airy structure was by all accounts a technological wonder. The Eiffel Tower remained the world’s tallest man-made structure until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York in 1930. The Eiffel Tower was almost demolished when the International Exposition’s 20-year lease on the land expired in 1909, but its value as an antenna for radio transmission saved it. It remains largely unchanged today and is one of the world’s premier tourist attractions.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Z9AEUhSE0/,post_1659.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ynMq4BKtOIE0lpmaVfLYmu5tEUuPDEx1
"Just after 6 p.m. on #ThisDayinHistory 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is fatally shot while standing on the balcony outside his second-story room at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. The civil rights leader was in Memphis to support a sanitation workers’ strike and was on his way to dinner when an assassin's bullet struck him. King was pronounced dead after his arrival at a Memphis hospital. He was 39 years old. — In the months before his assassination, Martin Luther King became increasingly concerned with the problem of economic inequality in America. He organized a Poor People’s Campaign to focus on the issue, including a march on Washington, and in March 1968 traveled to Memphis in support of poorly treated African-American sanitation workers. On March 28, a workers’ protest march led by King ended in violence and the death of an African-American teenager. King left the city but vowed to return in early April to lead another demonstration. — On April 3, back in Memphis, King gave his last sermon, saying, “We’ve got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn’t matter with me now, because I’ve been to the mountaintop … And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over, and I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the promised land.” — One day after speaking those words, Dr. King was shot and killed by a sniper. As word of the assassination spread, riots broke out in cities all across the United States and National Guard troops were deployed in Memphis and Washington, D.C. On April 9, King was laid to rest in his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-j4cDgBbk1/,post_1660.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1WT1aOrUgHIsSunpNLSgL2ms67CFcoSFC
"25 years ago, shortly after 9:00 a.m. on #ThisDayinHistory 1995, a Ryder rental truck exploded with terrifying force in front of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. The powerful explosion blew off the building’s entire north wall. Emergency crews raced to Oklahoma from across the country, and when the rescue effort finally ended two weeks later, the death toll stood at 168 people. The list of the deceased included 19 young children who were in the building’s day care center at the time of the blast. More than 650 other people were injured in the bombing, which damaged or destroyed over 300 buildings in the immediate area. -- The blast was set off by anti-government militant Timothy McVeigh, who in 2001 was executed for his crimes. His co-conspirator Terry Nichols was sentenced to life in prison. The Oklahoma City bombing was the worst terrorist attack to take place on U.S. soil until the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Church bells still ring just after 9 a.m. every April 19 in Oklahoma City. And some people still pull over their cars, or stop their meetings, to bow their heads for 168 seconds of silence—one second for each of the children and adults who died on that date in 1995. The Oklahoma City National Memorial was created to honor the victims, survivors, and rescuers affected by the bombing. It was dedicated on the fifth anniversary of the bombing and opened the following year.

In 1952—an epidemic year for polio—there were 58,000 new cases reported in the U.S., and more than 3,000 died from the disease. Salk first conducted research on viruses in the 1930s when he was a medical student, and during WWII helped develop flu vaccines. In 1947, he became head of a research laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh and in 1948 was awarded a grant to study the polio virus and develop a possible vaccine. By 1950, he had an early version of his vaccine. In 1954, clinical trials using the Salk vaccine and a placebo began on nearly two million American schoolchildren. In April 1955, it was announced that the vaccine was effective and safe. A nationwide inoculation campaign began. New polio cases dropped to under 6,000 in 1957, the first year after the vaccine was widely available. Among other honors, Jonas Salk was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977.

Lennon was under the impression that the press thought they would “make love in public,” however, the couples intention was to bring attention the the on-going peace talks in Paris between he U.S., South Vietnam, North Vietnam, and the National Liberation Front.

"Today is #NationalMedalofHonorDay. The first Medals of Honor were awarded on #ThisDayinHistory 1863. Abraham Lincoln created the Medal of Honor during the American Civil War to honor soldiers who exhibited gallantry in action. Pictured here is Audie Murphy, one of the most decorated combat soldiers of World War II. Murphy rose to the rank of 2nd lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He was wounded three times and fought in nine major campaigns. “Bravery is just determination to do a job that you know has to be done,” he told reporters upon returning home in 1945. “I just fought to stay alive, like anyone else, I guess.” The battle that earned Murphy the Medal of Honor occurred during the last stages of the Allied victory over Germans in France. Murphy acted as cover for infantrymen during a last desperate German tank attack. Climbing atop a U.S. tank destroyer, he took control of its .50-caliber machine gun, stopping the advance and suffering a leg wound. Upon his return, Murphy was invited to Hollywood by Jimmy Cagney, who saw the war hero’s picture on the cover of Life magazine. By 1950, Murphy had an acting contract with Universal Pictures.

"In an effort to raise funds to pay off debts and defend the vast new American territories won from the French in the Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), the British government passes the Stamp Act on #ThisDayinHistory 1765. The legislation levied a direct tax on all materials printed for commercial and legal use in the colonies, from newspapers and pamphlets to playing cards and dice. Though the Stamp Act employed a strategy that was a common fundraising vehicle in England, it stirred a storm of protest in the colonies. The colonists had recently been hit with three major taxes: the Sugar Act (1764), which levied new duties on imports of textiles, wines, coffee and sugar; the Currency Act (1764), which caused a major decline in the value of the paper money used by colonists; and the Quartering Act (1765), which required colonists to provide food and lodging to British troops. By October of that year, nine of the 13 colonies sent representatives to the Stamp Act Congress, at which the colonists drafted the “Declaration of Rights and Grievances,” a document that railed against the autocratic policies of the mercantilist British empire. The fracas over the Stamp Act, though, helped plant seeds for a far larger movement against the British government and the eventual battle for independence. Most important of these was the formation of the Sons of Liberty–a group of tradesmen who led anti-British protests in Boston and other seaboard cities–and other groups of wealthy landowners who came together from the across the colonies. Out of their meetings, a growing nationalism emerged that would culminate in the fighting of the American Revolution only a decade later.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B-CeLj9BH6l/,post_1672.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1SpHirhq4WSOaDU03pO0BmiI7hirM949u
"""A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new,"" observed Albert Einstein. In 1905—seen by many as a ""miracle year"" for the theorist—Einstein proposed the equation E=MC2: the energy of a body (E) is equal to the mass (M) of that body times the speed of light squared (C2). This equation suggested that tiny particles of matter could be converted into huge amounts of energy, a discovery that heralded atomic power. Einstein went on to win worldwide fame for his general theory of relativity and a Nobel Prize in 1921 for his explanation of the phenomenon known as the photoelectric effect.

Lincoln was reluctant to promote Grant and risk boosting the general’s popularity; at the time Washington was abuzz with rumors that many northern senators were considering nominating Grant instead of Lincoln at the 1864 Republican National Convention. After Grant publicly dismissed the idea of running for the presidency, Lincoln submitted to Congress’ choice and agreed to give Grant the revived rank. As lieutenant general of the U.S. Army, Grant was answerable only to Lincoln. Well-respected by troops and civilians, Grant earned Lincoln’s trust and went on to force the South’s surrender in 1865.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9jtBqbhy27/,post_1683.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16Qhj1dd8mfdVhBsrwusjx8D-oUvqneBG
"In 1975, recognized as International Women’s Year, the United Nations General Assembly began celebrating March 8 as International Women’s Day. By 2014, it was celebrated in more than 100 countries, and had been made an official holiday in more than 25. Over the years, however, many celebrations strayed far from the holiday’s political roots. The concept of a “woman’s day” caught on in Europe. On March 19, 1911 (the 40th anniversary of the Paris Commune, a radical socialist government that briefly ruled France in 1871), the first International Woman’s Day was held, drawing more than 1 million people to rallies worldwide. Most dramatically, a massive demonstration led by Russian feminist Alexandra Kollontai that began on March 8, 1917 proved to be a link in the chain of events that led to the abdication of Czar Nicholas II and the Russian Revolution. After the czar’s abdication, the provisional government formed until a constituent assembly could be elected became the first government of a major power to grant women the right to vote.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9eZyE3BbnX/,post_1684.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZszyEiX6CT45jfA5SUwhsXb4vbb9rwbB
"Moments before he was shot to death by a soldier of the Bolivian government, the revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara told his executioner, “Shoot, coward! You are only going to kill a man!” Guevara died a short time later, on October 9, 1967 at the age of 39, but he was correct in his assertion that this would not be the end of his legacy. Today, that legacy almost always takes the form of a single photograph, Guerrillero Heroico, which some have called the most famous photograph in the world. That photo was taken 60 years ago on #ThisDayinHistory 1960, at a funeral for workers killed in an explosion in a Cuban port that Fidel Castro’s revolutionary government blamed on the Americans. Guevara, a general in the revolution and the intellectual heavyweight of Castro’s regime, looked on as Castro delivered his fiery funeral oration. In addition to being held aloft at protests or hung in the homes of his admirers, Guevara's image has become popular as a fashion statement, adorning t-shirts and posters wherever counterculture is revered.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9XYbEGBspY/,post_1685.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Ocb7NqSiREXD547bw6MraIpiObrjOJBJ
"Tensions ran high in Boston in early 1770. More than 2,000 British soldiers occupied the city of 16,000 colonists and tried to enforce Britain’s tax laws, like the Stamp Act and Townshend Acts. American colonists rebelled against the taxes they found repressive, rallying around the cry, “no taxation without representation.” On the frigid, snowy evening 250 years ago on #ThisDayinHistory 1770, Private Hugh White was the only soldier guarding the King’s money stored inside the Custom House on King Street. It wasn’t long before angry colonists joined him and insulted him and threatened violence. At some point, White fought back and struck a colonist with his bayonet. In retaliation, the colonists pelted him with snowballs, ice and stones. Bells started ringing throughout the town—usually a warning of fire—sending a mass of male colonists into the streets. As the assault on White continued, he eventually fell and called for reinforcements. The violence escalated, and the colonists struck the soldiers with clubs and sticks. Reports differ of exactly what happened next, but after someone supposedly said the word “fire,” a soldier fired his gun, although it’s unclear if the discharge was intentional. Once the first shot rang out, other soldiers opened fire, killing five colonists–including Crispus Attucks, a local dockworker of mixed racial heritage–and wounding six. The event became known as The Boston Massacre which further incensed colonists already weary of British rule and unfair taxation and roused them to fight for independence.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9WxQBJhFY1/,post_1686.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1e1Nhuig73UAApeeIrEn42TwcDpF254fV

"“Mr. Watson, come here, I need you” were the first words spoken on the telephone by inventor Alexander Graham Bell. After becoming interested in the possibility of transmitting speech over wires, Bell sought to improve upon Samuel F.B. Morse’s invention of the telegraph in 1843. The drawback of the telegraph, however, was that it still required hand-delivery of messages between telegraph stations and recipients, and only one message could be transmitted at a time. With the help of Thomas A. Watson, a Boston machine shop employee, Bell developed a prototype. In this first telephone, sound waves caused an electric current to vary in intensity and frequency, causing a thin, soft iron plate–called the diaphragm–to vibrate. These vibrations were transferred magnetically to another wire connected to a diaphragm in another, distant instrument. Alexander Graham Bell received a patent for his revolutionary new invention–the telephone on #ThisDayinHistory 1876.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9b9r-sBKgA/,post_1688.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1O__cqQjMEqMDLuepAeBN96M50QNzHsGo

On September 14, 1814, Francis Scott Key composed the lyrics to “The Star-Spangled Banner” after witnessing the massive overnight British bombardment of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812. Key, an American lawyer, watched the siege while detained on a British ship. He penned the famous words after observing with awe that Fort McHenry’s flag survived the 1,800-bomb assault. The original ""Star-Spangled Banner"" that inspired Key's poem was displayed at the Boston Navy Yard until 1907, and has been at the Smithsonian Institution ever since.

"San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge, a stunning technological and artistic achievement, opens to the public after five years of construction on #ThisDayinHistory 1937. On opening day–“Pedestrian Day”–some 200,000 bridge walkers marveled at the 4,200-foot-long suspension bridge, which spans the Golden Gate Strait at the entrance to San Francisco Bay and connects San Francisco and Marin County. The next day, on May 28, the Golden Gate Bridge opened to vehicular traffic.  The concept of bridging the nearly mile-wide Golden Gate Strait was proposed as early as 1872, but it was not until the early 1920s that public opinion in San Francisco began to favor such an undertaking. In 1921, Cincinnati-born bridge engineer Joseph Strauss submitted a preliminary proposal. During the next few years, Strauss’ design evolved rapidly, thanks to the contributions of consulting engineer Leon S. Moisseiff, architect Irving F. Morrow, and others. Moisseiff’s concept of a simple suspension bridge was accepted by Strauss, and Morrow, along with his wife, Gertrude, developed the Golden Gate Bridge’s elegant Art Deco design. Morrow would later help choose the bridge’s trademark color: “international orange,” a brilliant vermilion color that resists rust and fading and suits the natural beauty of San Francisco and its picturesque sunsets. In 1929, Strauss was selected as chief engineer.  Construction began on January 5, 1933, at the depths of the Great Depression. Strauss and his workers overcame many difficulties: strong tides, frequent storms and fogs, and the problem of blasting rock 65 feet below the water to plant earthquake-proof foundations. Eleven men died during construction. At 4,200 feet, it was the longest bridge in the world until the completion of New York City’s Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in 1964. Today, the Golden Gate Bridge remains one of the world’s most recognizable architectural structures.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/CAs0o2Yh9xe/,post_1691.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KfrEHLimkhBtyl3zHKsKg6Utm1Foi3Wc

The final attack came before dawn as Mexican troops breached the north wall and flooded into the compound, awakening many of the Texans inside. The fighting lasted 90 minutes, some of it hand-to-hand combat. Alamo co-commanders James Bowie and William Travis were killed, as was legendary frontiersman Davy Crockett, although reports differ as to exactly how and when. Several Texans reportedly surrendered, but Mexican General Santa Anna ordered all prisoners be executed. Only a handful survived, mostly women and children.

Grant entered the White House in the middle of the Reconstruction era, a tumultuous period in which the 11 Southern states that seceded before or at the start of the Civil War were brought back into the Union. As president, Grant tried to foster a peaceful reconciliation between the North and South and he enacted measures to curb the terrorist actions of the Ku Klux Klan. In addition to focusing on Reconstruction, Grant signed legislation establishing the Department of Justice, the Weather Bureau (now known as the National Weather Service) and Yellowstone National Park, America’s first national park.

"The Tuskegee Airmen were the first black military aviators in the U.S. Army Air Corps (AAC), a precursor of the U.S. Air Force. The program’s trainees, nearly all of them college graduates or undergraduates, came from all over the country and trained at the Tuskegee Army Air Field in Alabama. They flew more than 15,000 individual sorties in Europe and North Africa during World War II. Their impressive performance earned them more than 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, and helped encourage the eventual integration of the U.S. armed forces. After their brave service, the Tuskegee Airmen returned home to a country where they continued to face systematic racism and prejudice.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8glxDBh6IX/,post_1725.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZyOoI7F3YL7Za7YF13Df81MIVEHQ7V8M

"Before they were dubbed vinegar valentines, these sassy cards were known as mocking or comic valentines. Their tone ranged from a gentle jab to downright aggressiveness. There was an insulting card for just about every person someone might dislike—from annoying salespeople and landlords to overbearing employers and adversaries of all kinds. Some cards mocked specific professions or were used to critique social movements like the effort among women to win the right to vote.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8jg1VNBto6/,post_1728.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jkOsyEE6vHUwuQhyaufMtJd09Zs8duvQ
"Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey was born around 1818 into slavery in Talbot County, Maryland.  As was often the case with enslaved people, the exact year and date of Douglass' birth are unknown, though later in life he chose to celebrate it on #ThisDayinHistory February 14. Douglass escaped enslavement and became a prominent activist, author and public speaker. He was a leader in the abolitionist movement. His 1845 autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, became an important clarion call for ending slavery. It was one of several books he penned, along with dozens of noteworthy speeches, despite receiving minimal formal education. An advocate for women’s rights, and specifically the right of women to vote, Douglass’ legacy as an author and leader lives on. His work served as an inspiration to the civil rights movement of the 1960s, and his legacy continues to shape your world.",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8jU48sBQvP/,post_1729.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=19sMeYyE413_uFxa-qXJsm3GP6TjOVt4h

At this time, the Harlem section of Manhattan drew nearly 175,000 African Americans to its neighborhood of just three square miles. The influx of people to the area led to a period of groundbreaking contributions in what became known as a the Harlem Renaissance. #BlackHistoryMonth",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9Hw7VWh7T9/,post_1731.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1suV2WO_zlmevkl6Tr7yjugzMJLMwny0e

"Josephine Baker spent her youth in poverty before learning to dance and finding success in the Harlem Renaissance. Baker landed a role in the musical Shuffle Along as a member of the chorus, and the special touch that she brought to the part made her popular with Broadway audiences. In 1925, at the peak of France’s obsession with American jazz and all things exotic, Baker traveled to Paris and became wildly popular. Baker was soon among the highest-paid performers in Europe, having the admiration of cultural figures like Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway and E. E. Cummings and earning herself nicknames like “Black Venus” and “Black Pearl.” #BlackHistoryMonth",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8RUb3tBW80/,post_1737.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1OZAYYfgMOY6QPcK2uMgiebrBa0KwaC1E

"Today is #nationalpizzaday. One of the first documented pizzerias in the U.S. was G. Lombardi’s on Spring Street in NYC, licensed to sell pizza in 1905. Here the owner and cook at Vince's Spaghetti House in Lake City, Seattle, tosses fresh pizza dough in 1959. Flatbreads with toppings were eaten by ancient Greeks, Egyptians and Romans. But the modern birthplace of pizza is the Italian city of Naples, located in the Campania region. When King Umberto I and Queen Margherita visited Naples in 1889, legend has it that they had become bored by French cuisine and requested pizzas from the pizzeria now known as Pizzeria Brandi. The queen‘s favorite was topped with soft white cheese, red tomatoes and basil. As the story goes, that particular topping combo became known as pizza Margherita. Though some purport different Margherita origin stories, this one has become part of pizza lore. Pizza was not widely known throughout Italy until the 1940s, but immigrants from Naples brought their pizza recipes to New York and other American cities and it became popularized in the 20th century. Today, it is beloved throughout the world. #nationalpizzaday",history,https://www.instagram.com/p/B8XHCBJhG8f/,post_1739.jpg,https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ARVVV9yJZulQ85DZFeyazozY8zTP4DWt
